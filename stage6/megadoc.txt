affinity sort exploitative game play series known while doesnt much distinguish itself castlevania updated excellent music added controls help refine series further bottom line whether youre familiar series not cant wrong dawn sorrow  game play overall feel game screams castlevania side scrolling platform action spot graphics truly push limits variety equipment soul combinations lend itself perfectly creating game play experience perfect style play people said past reviews touch screen feels tacked defeat bosses draw symbols screen frustrating poor penmanship left handed such yours truly scramble take stylus switch hand draw symbol neat little addition again didnt really need boss battles sometimes little too easy later levels dont wrong downright nasty bosses fire off special weapon screen thats overall another great game nintendo exception clunky touch screen add game overall fantastic  off cannot believe mad game has made like kinds games honestly trying figure levels game left stumped thing stuck somewhere retry lot several times during game stuck area had idea where etc killed bad guys didnt know room game not intuitive secondly game should not called incredibles should called incredible play almost time playing elasta girl great really enjoyed part lot baddies guns incredible pain since has block anything spend lot time getting pushed until bad guys reload liked mission dash play dash twice run fast however second mission lost patience had restart million times couldnt ahead playing violet bad should done lot more instead boring stealth mission incredi ball mission incredibi sucked took like hour hit something difficult place finishing game quite frankly haven enjoyed lot shame really loved movie levels too hard barely find something incredible needs more punch people currently rocket silo level keep falling down trying onto platform load fun times more bottom line playing elasta girl fun everything else either blah made swear lot hopefully second game better ill renting instead buying game left disappointed overall  shouldnt people know never buy movie games friend mine bought horrible too easy die etc etc etc hey listen keep money investment isnt here  bought party bundle boyfriends daughter birthday loves game has been weeks mic dead started static while while singing died completely know not great singer not bad  bought mic december nights singing completely died complete disappointment save money  game originally released dollars almost everything pulled straight diablo not quite good though game has few things interesting enjoyable people skip game diablo  game simply put not good got bored tears playing ended giving away robbing useful space desk slow paced predictable not suspenseful fact characteristics probably why mainstream though laughable comparison real person shooters dont belong consoles owning game means average player true fps gamer knows childish pathetic garbage while rest hype many successfully deceived themselves thinking worth anything isnt  really liked game years old high school bored seem play game time dont why buy were very fun challenging same time  love game daughter big ratchet clank fans games similar play found incredibles game exciting challenging playing wonder too easy times spot cant accomplish until times favourite thing game conquering level incredible mrs incredible dash violet etc great fun  used love game many better games plus game overrated not good storyline nerdy weapons not good  vertical stand wonderful why useless dvd cases duck tape put slim vertically helps why waste time buying product bought kicks literally  mic very durable wired good havent had problems much better headset  youre looking spend money dont having spent teen years holed bedroom commodore being current fan really excited heard product unfortunately stinks couple games contraption real gems rest being mediocre best overall bad choice games isnt issue thing though crummy joystick control horrible stick clunky unresponsive makes playing real chore someone else pointed review often doesnt respond pushed certain direction cant believe yet companies releasing plug play video game contraptions cant make decent joystick real let down  youre going play karaoke revolution mic wife play duet mode much better headset bucks real mic feels much more natural play lot invest microphone  not much fun remember maybe better had better selection games hardball etc  glad purchased logitech mic quality sound awesome kids having blast price reasonable kids take very good care things not sure withstand mistreatment probably end buying another one  purchased product niece having had positive experiences similar items finding price too tempting however had been hope introducing video games generation turned exercise frustration outset screw battery casing stripped very little application screwdriver titles suffered redundancy many required too many buttons disappointing aspect item potential possessed perhaps fewer similar titles configuration button commands ensure promise product  really excited saw item had commodore kid brother used spend hours hours playing games glad winter games summer games included until item arrived plugged tried play joystick doesnt move right down left big disappointment dont waste  second part xenosaga compares very badly stellar part regardless anyone says longer wanted play game minutes game begins lots boring instructions very non intuitive battle system annoying amount experience points needed defeat nearly every main enemy including very battle result saving screens painful chore battle camera inadequate characters act like small puppets game has very few items weapons armour deal ordinary enemies stronger expected skill combination successful main enemy not available until engaged enemy battles main enemies long isnt such problem however often conveniently power end battle frustratingly finish off battle weakened party voice acting very uninspired sometimes annoying dont remember music game plain character changes likely upset least half everyone liked xenosaga very noticeable swearing main reason dont enjoy watch hollywood movies during rest relaxation anymore new meaningless characters been introduced story focus shifted far away main characters cover character hardly says does anything time short scene between main characters during critical moment blink miss game far more frustrating challenging not good game trait dont recommend playing game before reading above fully prepare disappointment awaits youre looking forward anything made xenosaga great extremely disappointed second xenosaga better completely avoided  loved xenosaga arrived episode isnt bad game terms story intro absolutely dynamite battle like tactical stuff good game youre trying fight through hoard enemies save point record timing save money gone amazingly done battle system episode place stands completely nowhere new battling takes minutes rid couple easy enemies easy ones game around hps ridiculous thats not enemies weak zones depend height attack input zones being highest triangle square circle sometimes mean completely screwed become deeply addicted game understand full potential wasnt enough changed voice actors too kos moss voice sounds more like operator robots momo sounds like brat least chaos voice has improved prefer playing episode twice playing hope namco comes better sequel otherwise spend moey something else like shadow hearts example  has flaws run around bit between play areas plays enough price right worth time spend learning curve small music sound tracks buried deep neat extra has been around couple years nothing new though partner exploit during battle good change scenery liked enough finish too  pros mechs bigger part games actually graphics cut screens great graphics overall better before couple characters better much harder episode more optional bosses cons new battle system load mouse spunk spunk characters worse especially kos mos jin travels throughout space pants almost sidequests terrible very short story much weaker dictionary gone shions glasses shops why shops too much more list bad movie howard duck better this  like diablo exactly same game improved percent not blizzards bnet multi player options game better diablo  got game free box corn chex thought fun since show cool got home played annoying theres like black screen before question shows black background dont buy fun  not big fan diablo type game game really neat big advantage game diablo ability control characters game very high replay value makes game winner pick copy ive seen rather inexpensive local retail store price cant wrong  recently bought game dollars had always heard awesome had never played xbox ive been fan while played couple levels not disappointed game simply amazing today cant possibly imagine good must seemed came game play terrific graphics sound music game awesome highly recommend game bought not rented worth owning  halo blew everyone away came expecting beat looking games time definitely good game play youve never played person shooter xbox should awesome ratings graphics sound replayability controls drawn atmosphere fun multiplayer multiplay  everyone knows mean probably few troglodites wouldnt able figure least guess never mind dont bother hitting review helpful buttons this  disney interactive released wants millionaire early anticipated very warm response disc had firm low opening price however actually being played game sure depress isnt crudely simple design poor uninspired entire game essentially based lackluster thing regis philbin repeating same phrases over again sure wants millionaire hope youll join again wants millionaire doesnt decide resell simply trash game within week purchase disney interactive regis themselves dont waste time pitiful effort  rented contact gamefly played few days before deciding going purchase not too distant future unfortunately gamefly does not rent games along instruction manuals had learn everything game trial error doing pretty myself had stop myself playing anymore wouldnt waste purchase later reminded rpg type games ive played past such nes original zelda liked zelda youll probably like game buy borrow friend wholl loan manual too help may make difference  driving physics unrealistic obtaining licenses extremely difficult made worse poor car physics heavy car easily bounces off light cars while light cars easily derail heavy car turning steering wheel slightly produces heavy tire squeal thats sports tires long gone espn like replays reason cars thinner before analog tachometer has been reduced bar across screen mechanics headache prone made worse poor physics cars easily inadequate music ever game makes start used model certain makes nothing new however takes long time earn money better car horsepower upgrades make huge differences track game has mostly newer models almost none few years ago unlike good thing game dont drive time spec driving mode win races leave few minutes return victory screen help skipping painful early parts game powertrain still not modifiable compression bore stroke camshaft timing overlap valve size engine characteristics still not available poor driving physics engine modification not helped game loading times very long annoying loading indicator ever constant auto saving feature quick become annoying excessive amount confirmation screens game yet another disappointment much like makers game made quite clear know real cars drive like drive real gran tourismo series unlikely return used not racing game fan good enough buy good car make independent physics need play gran tourismo  dont buy crash entire xbox learn play forget cheats  looked new circuit board flash ram new modification options enthusiast package certainly new circuit board original version youll need great lengths make sure youre getting version possible good luck  looking codes like game shark had not not computer anything happens disk screwed wont able reinstall windows install new computer games offer rewards like unlimited health completion those games plan using best thing there  brings good old days playing games school  common complaints xenosaga battle system annoying ponderous regular battles forces spend many turns stocking decent damage enemies actually form codespeak people really saying not very bright several hours playing somehow never realized battle system efficiently puts great deal emphasis each characters attack attributes attacks classified either physical ether elementals fire ice lighting aura finally types slash pierce hit sound complicated little more average rpg not nearly bad something like vagrant story analyze enemy youre unfamiliar weaknesses change command bring character has proper attack across enemies physical elemental weaknesses ethers cast add element characters physical attack weakness ether elemental standard elemental spell ethers against need make battles flow nice normal pace reason vast majority players seemed never realize instead saw option using stock command nine nine turns row before beginning attack wimpy garden variety wandering monsters took heed enemy weaknesses using characters physical fire based attacks against enemies weak ether ice rpg players used reputation being more intelligent gamers wonder happened lot fans never bothered play negative word mouth spread quickly amongst fanbase soon version released iii truly fantastic lot finally play soon hope better rounders did  returned item refund found cheaper toys  preview has spoilers game please don read didnt play played xenogears saw xenosaga episode kinda short compare xenogears battle system xenosaga like introduction improvements gameplay longer episode ended episode everything hours change sidequest like plus don end game anyways idea epiloge finish game very cool kill special bosses better kill final boss overkilled stuff like chaos momo shion kosmos looking improved looked more grow battle system put down depending were using fighting double tech attacksall characters were able magic skills long buy skillpoints making able sidequests momo bow very nice improvement very good damage dealerrecover while stock good idea freely without trouble people complain history focus urtvs title says itself means beyond good evil wich means rubedo worring ladies danger red dragon mode wich makes control possible reason sakura death albedo obssesive love rubedo same time kill nigredo wich refused mission involved rubedo killed own father plays good person moment albedo said giving life hand delivering death honestly second episode history role more development wasnt introduction were starting know things were going did wrong don throw away tech attacks going good idea good thing added tech attacks special attacks had stock lot times make good combo between characters wich made battles kinda boring music battle kinda boring compare voices chaos sounded boring kos mos like fake silly girl trying play robot shion pushing like better momo very annoying sad thing main team chaos kosmos momo thats why got sad voice changes said refix voices episode third last episode has almost hours movies hours guess complains long movies still don movies more motion storyrole game wich attractive things xenosaga has games episode hours full motion movies plus speak texts faces included while characters move stuff like valkyrie profilethey cut completely close cast spells hit lights stuff time characters while fighting fix resume everyone know episode had bad things good things every game shouldnt did bad noticed things people like game itself good thing fixed bad stuff episode episode battle system soundtrack characters voices better thing didnt like episode battle mode make appear average rpg system attack ether tech special tech others forget combinations make tech attacks ethers cost special attacks cost boosts wonder attack later recommend buy before episode losing lot storyline don more cost dollars each less atte roy master  small memory means put save run comp everytime wanna save software very confusing horrible buy returned piece junk  extremity disappointed game every section mission exactly same exception location absolutely skill involved beating game able sittings  while reviews xenosaga little harsh hit few good points terms plot thing really let down kos mos dont let face covering cover game fool while being main characters game hardly does anything game until end seems less like plot point more creators obliging same said shion shift center stage hurts characters really disappointing instead takes center stage instead shedding light events game opens whole knew set issues really dont resolved youre looking story pull game had itll hard find game character personally dont care much fan youll enjoy game learn lot past new character introduced shions brother jin uzuki personally liked jin dont much game shion albedo underlying theme brothers siblings story although dont much elaboration jin shion although people arent pleased battle system game actually enjoyed caught quicker games system acquire skill points enemies weak zones found very useful liked being able build attacks boost really slam enemy overall game really enjoyed game has replay value certain things actually cant accomplish until youve beaten game once times watching certain scenes over again gets boring yet recommend series nothing else serves bridge between game upcoming third game  really wow players real football through players torsos skate glide around field mph without moving legs wrs change direction foot pivot glide elude tackles anyone plays game madden level notice right away furthest thing realistic football game nerds thinking enjoy making game whos constantly cheats love tout games user more control user has very little control anything goes game dont control catch drop intercept line blocks dbs cover assignment none computer makes line miss blocks not block drop easy picks drop easy catches etc why why dts lbs faster fastest realistic terrible blatantly unrealistically cheats terrible game stop making games final product  game joke same exact game version minimal additions online play glitchy drops often not worth time not buy game thinking better hype play great football game nfl ksports sega sports game years old blows madden away week able roster manager change rosters make current edit players create rookies like reggie bush jerious norwood make roster same current nfl lineups madden bought rights official nfl game sole reason madden sucks wants make money not spend money improving game madden bought rights nfl trademak through companies make official nfl game thats why game football game compete thats why blitz game cannot nfl players generic game without real players hate madden passion sports sports game including football manual labor updating rosters once current still better madden ever not buy game  swear wasnt liked final fantasy much break game move happy cant waste money thing kept game fact didnt waste money game makes kingdom hearts like rated game god childish know final fantasy games try make main character cool didnt feel like doing monkey man stupid plus character more dumb looking main happy beat put awful exp behind ahhhhhhhhhh  been extremely devoted smb fan since very time laid eyes own stood line night saturday through sunday morning made sure grab myself copy smb banana blitz brand new wii bought entire set controllers anticipating mini game fun friends were huge smb fans always makes appearance parties really angry completely gutted favourite mini game hitting monkey target worst honestly dont care freaking mini games monkey target completely worthless instead amazingly subtle game play bonus items increasingly difficult levels magnets velcro double bonuses wind speed direction import ramp run off cannon level wind wind direction bonuses special items cares sort pilot submarine single level monkey squash joy lot controls mini games terrible forth new mini games suck almost unilaterally gosh darn volume does not make lack quality love traditional smb levels ones smb banana blitz nice graphics beautiful fun best part game friends gone dead none reviews read mentioned fact favourite smb players killed like had certainly wouldnt wasted plus tax sega people reading bring monkey target thats people play parties theyre slightly drunk sick listening super smash brothers too awake enjoy mario party  game race lovers awesome graphics car response like real thing photo lab very nice too take pics rides never bored game must have  really good game war buy since very good  used product soft mod xbox had download older version software though cheat games probably not worth money  action replay xbox multi player games like halo codes make unlimited ammo reason why product unlimited ammo not reload invisibility obvious cheating read probablly thought gonna like cheating guy doesnt reload doesnt run ammo still like know before buy probably end buying anyways wut pup  said earlier review creators final fantasy giving everything actually asked gave advent children cell phone games finally dirge cerberus game action based game showing life under used least interesting character final fantasy series creators telling never make final fantasy vii rather insult every marketing ploy know man  yes die hard star wars fan yes love good mission based action game man isnt perfect game much fun theres much freedom game itself add space missions wow game totally blows away highly recommended anyone star wars fan fps fan fan fun game play  ive had game since came still not sick anyone enjoys halo multiplayer enjoy game lucasarts improved everything battlefront story mode galactic conquest strategy mode excellent additions basic battlefront where simply take bases kill enemy thank goodness still kept game miss old scenarios lot new scenarios really good new controls make battlefront totally worth playing love improved controls new characters new space battles ability sprint ingenious addition games walk run game characters ability run very fast sprinting kneel lay dive roll hope future action games adopt wish characters had ability punch someone everything else ability change character bases control nice addition engineers ability repair things take occupied enemy vehicles great nice array weapons ability play specialized characters such darth vader boba fett awesome space battles really fun except board enemy ship limited areas access graphics great pros controlsability sprintchange characters basesengineers repair things steal enemy vehiclesgraphicsmultiple scenariosa lot charactersplay specialty characters jedi space battlesmultiple playing options strategy mode story mode basic battlefront mode cons characters dont ability punch someone boarding enemy ship space battle has very limited access enemy ship fun scenarios battlefront not option flying multiple ships playing multiple characters using turrets both space battles regular battles multiple things characters make game worth playing  been playing madden series since kid game really good games keep getting better better each passes everything game worth money strongly recommend  start off saying own version dont bother updating may not notice many updates upgrades awesome game yes has few holes still too much sacking cpu cpu run ball darn often joke game might strain loads often play madden level forced play vision know stinks basically tossed few more options play blocker etc offense more advanced defensive controls such match ups assignments etc franchise mode still really great superstar mode quite enjoyable game really good safe graphics quite good commentary solid once again crispness passing great running game big part years focus still really fun running strong arm easy dominate game btw new kicking scheme actually really easy test time making fgs easily fully tinker change settings rosters accurate personally own madden wait more weeks buy best game  people gave game review more stars ing those people probably hardcore fans game barely mediocre best releases advent children cell phone game movie show thing three things respectively sucked comes dierge cerberus whoop did eeee doo reason why rented title says final fantasy redeeming quality game cutscenes boring more minutes through game means game you  pretty fun game few quirks here include annoying click button interface few problems random guess solve has very good graphics very addictive story line  really wanted like game unfortunately blows trade migraine game play pretty horrible sword scenes reminiscent adventure games circa where press attack key swing sword aimlessly bad guy runandgun part game nothing write home either feels like being teleported body cracked legged drunken monkey know graphics arent wiis strong point excuse regress bit youre trying shoot someone across room really sucks cant tell apart flower pot lawn chair cut scenes were obviously supposed like sin city stress word supposed cause were probably strung together poor intern development team went hiding like amateur flash slide show kinda like local momandpop video editor put together little nephew had gotten had sin city themed bar mitzvah game joke anybody associated should embarrassed  cant stand game minutes game unresponsive not funny board wanted throw remote friend watching asked hell going seriously didnt move remote guy starts spinning around thought maybe control calibration wrong playing trauma center before red steel not once did problem controls seriously worst game ever played  perfect example false advertisement youre like many ive heard trying order remote playstation dont order unless newer model picture shows unit doesnt save yourself hassle dont order this  game great enjoyed game favorites recommend game anyone enjoys final fantasy good rpg  perhaps best final fantasy games sadly under appreciated had amazing animation backgrounds beautiful music score solid game play characters delightful series personally vivi zidane coolest characters ever lastly gorgeous cut scenes deliver beautiful epic story line side note game definitely deserves remake theres lot hype final fantasy vii own prequel remake coming feel final fantasy should remade love story line better vii graphics were better game play incredible  saw dvd player target yesterday especially dont need xbox remote space saving maybe  simple dvd player long friend own box console simply push little plastic knob controller socket know own standard line dvd player magnification great rewind fast forward great has extras normal dvd player has easy operate menu layout overloads pointless buttons point obvious structure may disappointed response time not entirely remote players fault own old box console low memory box console may encounter slowness maxed freezing mint condition titles may not purchased little nicky sometime ago mint date still does not box console batteries may play roll doubt though easy portable dvd player around acknowledgement owning box console must gamer movie lover wit large movie library constant renter  hey kids fire xbox lets watch movie heard through households own xbox reason another still dont already dvd player like title suggests already dvd player waste money reason purchased dvd player had problems playing dvd got friend had money burn wanted xbox dvd kit play determine dvd bad burn dvd player found xbox able play dvd question problem however aside those dvd dvds own bought retail stores really need play dvd dvd player plays normal discs perfectly being said used xboxs dvd playback kit once watch dvd had problems content burned movies really need watch again however push comes shove always pcs mac watch burned dvd need xbox meant return dvd kit next never got around xboxs dvd player good feature fact microsoft charges feature makes not worth money unless course dont dvd player  quick delivery product arrived time excellent condition quality shipping thank  experience product opened started play dvd xbox tried pause didnt had brand new batteries found much frustration smacked against hand few times minutes took exchange another hopes bad unit sold got money buy dvd player not much more overpriced piece junk costs  love game beautiful little princes boy tail loves princesses played game over still play more dont ever tired much fun  weve heard final fantasy final fantasy does anyone ever mention game between final fantasy sadly underestimated game final fantasy series pulled condom though around years old still love reason not famous others probably came playstation before playstation came story line spellbinding captures right beginning flows beautifully through cities eternal rain clashing monsters traditional plot theme almost every rpg alive fate world itself everyone relate characters struggle find where belong end find almost find meaning stunning finale youll find yourself cheering mourning become attached dies music nob youve outdone yourself songs masterpieces youll find yourself humming youre not alone melodies life without knowing course couple pieces bring amusing scenes mentioning name slew love letters anyone cons hard question were problem cant target perhaps leveling character may take while again thats traditional part every game shouldnt counted being able play few legendary characters irately beatrix great take away status wouldnt thats opinion ill let slide until head explodes wont able target actual flaw lariat find final fantasy perfect rpg game overall again has got greatest game ive played others popular series dont strike like wait listening play once review like degrading game  not dvd thing causes xbox break play games disk doesnt constantly spin reads takes break doesnt heat reads dvd must constantly spin dvd playback kit frayed xbox best buy buy footplate functions better less money xbox  sucks main person keeps running around keeps running walking controlled through key board fwd bike control wont peddle gos backwards quite tryed different setups reloads nothing worked atleast bought used not much money maybe ill find fix try again later  great game include whole family entertain people party sometimes lot people dance party overall great game recommend buy  going start review saying came wii lifetime gamer never felt need buy console until wii fun controller system came aspect excited controlling person shooters precisely intuitively mouse keyboard together added entertainment using motion activated actions within game rowing throwing grenades close combat etc result spending night cold console flushed excitement seeing merchandise grabbed three games zelda brainer trauma center call duty those three titles sorry cod leave bitter taste mouth stated before gamer really hobby love satisfaction building manage latest games played cod greatly enjoyed both far biggest problem wii version however especially someone accustomed playing computer graphical shortcomings title literally had idea going barely tell direction enemies were coming reason why going right direction linear construction levels added had idea rid german engage hand hand combat much advertised feature actually interactive cut scene followed instructions wave controllers around wildly although worked myself frenzy causing dogs panic something really attacking inevitable german tried throwing grenades room hides kept clubbing death beyond setback found controls were often quite poorly implemented disappointing yet speaks volumes grenade throwing function involves actually throwing nunchuck without letting unless youve got backup disabled default trying usually gets miss target cut down blow yourself record know wii controller works ive played many hours games already system conveniently informs seems like shoddy implementation definitely tell lot ambition here convey frenzy war obvious strong attempts creating absorbing combat scenes nevertheless essentially boils down being messy soup blurry pixels game play graphics mentality buying wii blocks enjoyability title honest has made isnt best suited area wii historical titles tend rely great deal cinematically portraying visceral splendor war rather pushing exciting new game play elements advice fps front wait wii far cry game turns meantime countless hours great titles more suited wii graphics waiting attention before leaving like clarify thing perspective someone has very little experience consoles perhaps youre reaction game very different wii straight gamecube instead high definition gaming youre still determined buy keep eye used copy game going need money banana blitz  havent got play yet game does not logo comes screen goes blank nothing happens thought maybe disc exchanged same thing happened called ubisoft said many people slim called doesnt dont answers sony said error format discs may not many not buy dont risk not working  already eye toy favourite game beat freak eye toy groove tracks cover years great dance music elvis good charlotte old woman got alternative boring repetitive workout tapes great success game has calorie counter built fun game play three kids ages preschoolers occasionally babysit enjoy special effects chill room lyrics songs suitable family listening more dance dance revolution  couldnt stand nba ballers thought game try pros create ballernice graphicscons defense fan pheonix sun basketball love game announcer needs learn englishthe whole ball trick stick horrible sreaming youre stuck second side game required before advance tourthat stupid mic trick allows score points shotstupid watch trick cant stop despite fact still move player cant block not choose face game modes unless playing player guess game ill trading nba live wwe smackdown raw fall  let break itdown game isnt thatb great infact sucks ice reason giving game fear grade really really cant blame made game fact worst years throwing game face arent really great games movies arent doing good suchest wait wii comes promise disoponte dont buy every thing wait till dont waiste mone  why party memory cards store least double information memory cards priced love best systems ever played owned memory card stuff scam already own cards need more  without doubt worste game ever purchased basiclly big empty landscape bosses climb beat made decent game easily puting minions characters talk buy stuff right really really really crappy version zelda orcarina time respect decent video games not buy video game unless sole purpose setting fire stomping  gave star less game played box great came bought big mistake control too hard learn battle cant stop keys used together too many keys need push together simplest thing wasted money game deleted never play dont waste money  ordered amazon shipped btech ive had luck communicator self quite comfortable cannot comment quality mic audio comes through not charge called logitech tech support tech asked usual questions plugged tried different wall outlet tried jiggling plug communicator end questions tech said defective were running dangerously low stock particular guess trying order own risk hope better luck did  let yes mic has nice feel being wireless adds attractivness mic long time wearing really hurt ear becomes very uncomfortable wear has given headaches being friend needed headset both bought longer headset while freind has choice till gets constantly has hold switching mic ear cause ear starting hurt controller headset being wireless becoming more availible wait cause end headset isnt worth price wont compatible  might little misleading battle mechanics almost exactly same those game heck nippon ichis games though series best lot part game absolutely delivers great classes good monsters more consistent class sytem excellent assortment items good variety levels however far story area hour darkness solid game falls face writing iffy plot itself contrived characters while certainly amusing predictable leaves much desired youre looking storyline involved game youre game play though dont miss class tweaks few added features cursed memories worthy addition those simply monotonous level madness thrive great art mixed fun environments hilarious quips item descriptions engaging fights hundreds hours literally entertainment  played games doom series metroid prime medal honor golden eye youve played halo person shooter games exactly same dont care many times box magazine odd magazine drools box game systems magazine calls greatest game time rather play mario power tennis atrocious story absolutely appauling terms science fiction orientated theme utterly mundane unoriginal boring around unentertaining game play generic creation fresh college video game designer music cliche voice acting flat master chief around retard weapons boy weapons again another lame aspect game aliens weapons like something kids toy gun section toys human guns nothing havent used resident evil game halo came didnt big deal didnt play eventually got myself box decided installment shot huge mistake none games box worth owning system fable decent got old beating few times knights old republic series boring everything else box play gamecube  halo steroids halo clear microsoft stamp bungies creativity control muddies balanced game play hackneyed single player story makes sense has flow along levels arent replayable thought library halo tedious try headache inducing map design game nonsense unneccesary switch elites perspective half game along new group covenant bad guys like rejects captain planet cartoon apes mohawks yeah nice design play levels single player noobish loses appeal quickly multiplayer okay upon release great game took time level ranking system wasnt abused once new maps kept harddrive read mod kids were released bungie opened door full blown chaos years later modding has died down somewhat whole new slew bridging connection speed manipulation makes roughly likely youll find game lag still play occasion lame cant offer dedicated servers play map choice choose servers good connections modders big gun noobs find type game play too pray halo multiplayer improves system otherwise done xbox console permanently  before done final fantasy vii ordered game loved game thought final fantasy vii good viii must better boy wrong not bashing final fantasy viii kind liked game big problems draw system kind hard liked change pace equip summon gfs guardian force hard boring music game reminds music movie akira bad thing characters battle remind crash dummies new weapons making junk shops not characters not very likeable main characters squall member seed jerk everybody zell member seed surfer dude dunce quistis teacher member seed seems like squall reason another seifer squalls rival worse squall rinoa member owls square soft ran ideas like aeris selphie member seed weird character sad kingdom hearts laguna galbadian soldier best charecter game irvine member seed ladys man recycled later final fantasy better charecter known zidane game second worst final fantasy game ever made story great playing bad almost unbelivable square soft remade game psp buy removed draw system  liked disgaea love second game builds upon strong points previous game instead taking forever powerful characters achieve characters like archer ninja etc much quicker main characters still hilarious love fact laharl etna gang again prism rangers once again plot isnt too twisted enjoyable game play though similar old more options join dark assembly item world not level item assembly improve luck item purchase items such alcohol bombs influence assembly new addition subpoena felony charges characters receive based upon too many murders too much etc etc medals honor demon world allow characters more prestige not mention once again make item world another bonus transfer bailiff subpoena onto item felony charge level item same time game fabulous addition gamers collection highly recommend enjoy  going write review mostly those familiar original disgaea such not much aspect game play system game aside things changed important note having said lets begin game begins land veldime alternate world game where evil overlord named zenon has hidden everyone came veldime however placed curse land changed humans demons effects werent immediate still several human qualities curse not reversed soon turning thus hero adell oddly enough person unaffected zenons curse sets defeat overlord opening attempt summon zenon adell fight goes awry zenons daughter accidentally gets summoned instead bound adell summoning pact has choice accompany castle where intends kill father albeit not without scheming bit herself nutshell story good nothing amazing ample opportunity humor love original really new additions battles ability stack attacks quick enough throw diagnally basis stack attacks building tower aliies using lift command person bottom tower still has ability attack doing begin passing enemy tower everyone taking shot spiking ground essentially team attack characters been updates dark assembly factions senators being introduced easier pass bills lucky since quite often senators show vote drunk random vote basically asleep vote perhaps entertaining addition though felonies recieve felony things such power leveling having much mana killing own allies benifit felonies top stat boosts may easier pass proposals dark assembly every felony character gain extra exp works felonies exp bonus game has made necessary additions make game play top original however opinion feels like something missing characters seem bit more book not wonderfully absurd original voice acting isnt quite good disgaea plus etna has new voice actress despite however game plays much better looks bit smoother boot great game worthy sequel amazing game while may like changes characters others may not denying core game much better original keep addicted long not longer  far worst instance overzealous copy protection ive ever experienced bought game new local store ive been itching play simcity game not new video card got game home installed fine came time launch game said disc authentication failed tried disc failed again went companys support forums found lot people same problem had done anything help thankfully people store were very reasonable gave full refund  dont buy unless starforce malware computer understand publishers wanting prevent piracy not expense replacing drivers need dvd burner check search engines yourself otherwise been great game too bad isnt playable malware  starforce nothing else need said starforce singlehandly has destroyed number great games dont know since not single play dell xps gaming laptop  bought game sounded like lot fun tried installing dell laptop dice not run tried installing dell desktop computer again not run went knowledge base technical support lists integrated video card game not system short counter system cannot run game computer find ridiculous disappointing not suggest buying game until technical support page requirements game play especially since little facts not listed box  game sucks tries sim city extra features unfortunately graphics below average fact screens like were designed art student interface clumsy not intuitive big fan sim city series game really falls short  bought grandson not heard complaints matter fact havent heard noise busy playing  final fantasy vii dirge cerberus said last spin off aside psps crisis core goes furthest future vii world game seems like must play final fantasy vii vincent valentine fans alike thinking those fans probably play mostly rpgs game relatively easier popular fps shooters like halo being rpg fan yet still wanting learn story game very happy easy difficulty though bumped something more difficult plenty extras difficult outside story mode controls little bad nothing someone cant used squares second third shooter games pretty good recommend youre doing did playing story official guide hidden capsules unlocks cutscenes once retrieve never again guide actually pretty good game soundtrack youre fan final fantasy music definitely pick soundtrack lastly youre final fantasy fan rpg fan game everything related worth couldnt put game down characters bit under developed youre shooter fan games like halo probably disappointed  game has starforce copy protection software not computer reportedly replaces dvd drivers often causes extreme hardware software problems ive been victim software problems basically crippled very expensive scsi scanners extremely difficult figure doing best game thats ever been produced anyone whos had starforce experience going steer clear  controller feels great hands fact using controller awhile batteries went low had switch dualshock controller dualshock felt wierd hands response controller good had controller long time not experienced lag time down side controller returned controllers has stopped working short period time guess time charm working fine almost year  purchased remote control make watching dvds easier had problems getting consistantly right box had press buttons very hard hoped better got worse using game controler threw remote control away never recommend product  know pelican screen protectors styluses tempting theyre always cheapest ones available should tell something top screen uses adhesive smooth plastic middle edges leave sticky goo screen edge different material middle insanely difficult squeeze air bubbles being adhesive trying again again isnt much option furthermore sticky edge white not clear looks horrible onyx lite having much difficulty top screen protector checked online reviews read several reports

exchanged again third has bit dust september not really heavy gamer play madden ncaa sparingly very disappointed repeat problem notice button sticking issue others refer here tried putting little graphite make not stick seemed while really cant beat convenience wireless every aspect controller great except durability  people dont know game not really bad game average arcade shooter more often not cant hit enemy action occurs quickly pop behind something dead meat pick second like play good time crisis game  same opinion everyone else controller very convenient appealing affordable fun suddenly stopped working problems wireless connection very frustrating being middle action boom controller stops respondind killed sucks lot people same problem solve changing batteries putting again dual shock while plug logitech again has worked sounds silly somehow works great wireless controller aware problem little annoying probably too  ive never bought wireless controller before wasnt sure expect turns probably comfortable video game controller world logitech wireless action controller every bit comfortable dualshock very curvy controller fits almost too perfectly palms hands buttons placed great buttons never noticeably stick full pad hundreds times better sonys segmented pad analog sticks extremely sensitive responding lightest touch start select analog buttons though analog called mode controller new button turns vibration off placement four good enough wont using often anyways lag time wonderful controller noticeable lag whatsoever radio frequency causes interference reciever small barely noticable not bit dare cute controllers weight excellent too runs batteries yet unbelievably light battery door does not stick uncomfortably either batteries last hours vibration off wont know youre playing youre middle violent gunfight somewhere good size comfortable barely larger dualshock plus cords trip pull controller slot add mess cords behind entertainment center small bad point vbration feature not good dualshocks too many good things here controller make invaluable buy minor drawback verdict guilty charges being invaluable piece hardware aside console itself world sentenced bought consumers around world case dismissed  like game good review unless read fine print may dissapointed discover doesnt lcd televisions incompatible rear projection plasma television sets  using cordless controllers xbox controller like lot more comfortable small enough not too big right weight not too light couldnt ask better controller unless logitech made wired controller leather handles wireless find myself much more pleased buy isnt better wireless controller there  game has good concept nice graphics definitely funny moments game play total bore main game play styles investigation trial investigation worst involves nothing more checking everything room talking everyone ton pointless reading much like old point click adventure court sections little better not much once again very linear dont brain much try options once again huge amount reading too much dialogue packed game not near enough actual game play talking aimless too very little actually

compared both delivered vibrating dual shock controller standard unit controller feels great thumb pads thumb sticks allowing sorts movement suddenly four years released games like metal gear solid iii snake eater god war improve thumb pad function new mini games feature controller has been given new life big negative problem sony controllers extremely poor quality controller design dual shock shocked suddenly break drop floor easily damage wing buttons dont drop wing buttons usually break less enjoy gaming next shock going through many controllers design flaw adding cost each controller

controller feels like has sand rolling around inside handheld conditioning controller far robust used very similar logitech cordless rumblepad same design controller proper robust model comparing side side makes controller like developed ussr early something fact sony done absolutely nothing improve quality own generic controller probably reason why made much money unit too expensive controller

far controller goes works great not had single problem  bought game days ago finally got missing piece plastic middle not play game case damage  played game got bored minutes shoot kill people nothing police chase you shoot bring girls car dont recommend game overrated  bought xbox came very good rate time son enjoyed returned vacation turned saw smoke dont feel paying item price fair months cant person sold xbox has tried email since ive emailed hmmmm  game horrible rented days returned hours rented had wasted bucks pathetic cant anything graphics horrible cut scenes long commercials characters gay pros sunny bite garcons horrible graphics playable characters bad humor short cuteness cant anything path game hardly seriously doesnt like  not false advertisement meant newer models playstation built receiver why doesnt include  did not review comments game before posting been playing final fantasy games very long time still play mystic quest final fantasy iii snes xii best final fantasy since opinion fun story line awesome kinda like shakespeare meets king arthur reminds bit final fantasy awesome graphics peeve games leveling felt like mastered new doing changed next game old games did automatically those had equip things order gain strength magic special abilities game combines already learned vii never played game great tutorial access time game plain fun fun since iii freedom explore wander without getting lost reminder bottom map show where whatever contact friends foes storyline game play phenomenal  extension cable did not standard microsoft controller unless still old monster sized xbox controller cables worthless  finished almost final fantasy games tactics xii best game play final fantasy ever dream off since childhood summarize follows game play rate stars here max game looks boring once party system called gambit game extremely fun battle environment superb looks much like real battle battle scene random battle everything appears map multiple attacks land enemy same time camera view half global everything obstacle front behind left right above not below though since floor obstacle like real thing thing final fantasy graphic superb rendered texture looks inferior highest quality cut scene displayed cut scene better since sometimes cut scene looks really bad more satisfied something smoothly good average not too good cut scene extremely bad times music superb thus far normal battle music does not matter music not great listen separately suits game environment lot trivia town huge like real town approximately more people talk each town costume looks different not like old series game where town person town may looks exactly alike another town notice xii notice meticulously similarity overall everyone looks unique another thing environment looks much like star wars lord rings though put more emphasis former watch star wars episode why looks much like star wars cons cons nothing compared pros storyline quite simple plot twist thus fat played not many things stimulate players know happen next unlike ffx game introduced many interesting plots beginning gradually unraveled game proceeded were watch movies cut scene ffxii sounds like normal battle story middle age why many tech transportation voice voice actors game quite disappointing did good job admitted voices doesnt seem sound good example compared main female protagonist has unique voice xii sounds like typical american people second main female protagonist sounds unique ffxii sounds not great main antagonist sounds mysteriously great ffxii sounds quite dull sounds main male protagonist  try keep brief hrs through got city rabernastre dalmasca city bahjerba quickly impressions game were strange like meh dunno keep playing maybe min getting weirdness really sucks ugh really wish didnt midterms coming home play pros love battle system still strategy doesnt require random battles ugh hate whzzzhhh starting random battles still feel control doing less actual like everyone else says always good story though not much character development focus previous ones like whole war polity centered plot does follow ffts tradition actually like license board people said pain beginning far hasnt been case granted did very early game decide level vaan bit min really need know board really need dont randomly buy spots board things become available difficult person learn everything plan plan plan right constructing chars game hints time around ill follow already licensed equipment abilities hint theyll good huge game lots stuff quite beautiful character design course always someone love har har har fangirl must love basch lol tho love babyface earlier characters vaan too babyfaced looks like kid haha college student such fangirl haha sad isnt were guy like fran course subject personal opinion like subs like not bland fancy font time kinda reminds nochnoi dozor makes game really movie ish widescreen capability looks sweet widescreen monitor course everyone always talks realism selling pelts not like free moving camera thank heaven love hated still camera immensely ffx cute monsters lol love cactuar like monster rogue tomato love avoid boss moves skillfully moving around cons huge game yes con lots time running around good thing characters dont run painstakingly slow tidus did ffx meh neutral voices dunno people liking previous ffs voice actors anyhoo thought time were better ones prev ffs voice actors were okay not great here voice actors really good choice seems strange like problem frans voice strange choice strange voice balthiers voice doesnt seem really like voice acting itself sum voices though really acted didnt seem fit actors however favor good actors mismatched roles okay actors matched roles voice acting mild thumbs reading review mentioned mispronunciations feel must address someone speaks french did twitch heard marquis pronounced both markus marquis rather markee did twitch pronounced fete feet rather feh soundtrack liked music lot taken fft esp battle music estersand totally taken fft obviously both take place same world did enjoy non midi renditions themes rest new guys music meh wasnt particularly bad didnt really stand much either  tediously long weary nothing interesting lot borrowed ideas rtcw etc sick this  beautiful graphics nice storyline amount times game freezes receive error awful not mention monsters level youll never advantage pretty much beat game level  gta series has created new thresshold video games creation gta games became increasingly more violent more controversial san andreas exception game did not bear gta tag probably rated higher needless bit disappointed rockstar did addition gta series previous gtas had quirky jab political social icons particularly conversation political social icons san andreas had much lesser extent disappointed another thing disappointed game rpg like system put accuracy determined often practice rather players ability shoot unlike previous gtas must press button slow walking speed down manually aim fire gun hated change game play severely limits ability rampages forces god awful auto aim system had not added function game probably enjoyed lot more being said were plenty things enjoyed game off enjoyed new depth theyve added missions previously missions were followed kill blow run guys avoid cops missions game actually feel like rock star put lot time each individual objective mission particularly comes mind mission where hop plane small shootout inside vehicle fly liberty cities location cannot travel normally assassinate crime bosses little things like show extra effort designers put game another thing enjoyed game more challenging previous gtas very last mission cussing like mad havent achieved fire proofing firetruck missions game designed skill level someone has been playing gta long time map frigging huge times size regular gta game however unlike previous gtas not packed little goodies special jumps every corner still fun explore every corner map game though break down review pros incredibly large map challenging more new vehicles hijack overall improvement missions plenty extra features gang wars good voice acting cons new style shooting huge hindrance areas not packed goodies before fewer political cheap shots sas predecessors overall game comparison video games everywhere compared predecessors being average note ati radeon may encounter problems playing game not lag actually loading game  not really being original gta iii birds eye view predecessors became unfortunately addicted san andreas game play absorbing storyline cinematics despite dated graphics engaging maybe impressive aspect entire game impressive cinematic scene voice acting makes forget jerky animations game play free ranging dont pursue main storyline missions linear multiple storylines let pursue priority gratuitous violence commit ultimately unrewarding difficult away should moral criticisms game include being able randomly assault innocent bystanders without repercussions part repercussions nearby police doing criticism not enough repercussions street violence certainly make aspect game more challenging rampage local store clerks dont try call police evade instead take beating bullet rival gangs little clumsy too simply start shooting colors despite presence squad cars bike cops across street cops san andreas corrupt not corrupt gta definitely feels like ported title rather game developed interface game menus awkward designed game pad friendly saving game bit pain since retreat safe house save every time fun engrossing game adults let known let under child play game awful parent deserve social services whisk precious babies away aside violence san andreas rife profanity innuendo probably not really suitable anyone under safe mode low gore level game like titles while game overly violent gore minimal anyway  bought game couple weeks ago hesitating buying initially finally did good hype game wish didnt buy fair admit game has astonishing landscape cities level details game dont ever seen suhc creativity perfectness earlier games sure lot people find such features enough adore game landscape not enough since largest downside story story perspective abandoned playing closing oblivion gate dont excitement playing game further explored cities though quite quickly conversation looks silly every time camera zoom person chatting nice couple times waiting sweet gothic honestly prefer playing gothic playing oblivion tell action excitment talking like got gothic played almost hours straight food sleep drink water play play lots play  might suspect gta san adreas has classic anarchist fun insane driving guns galore lawless protagonist linear storyline lets honest though nobody buys gta play mission part fact hard time getting missions san andreas larger area game play few cities explore once advanced game unless cheat clear aspect sets game apart previous ones depth game play haircuts tattoos available purchase various parts character built fat hunger muscle driving skill weapon skill etc obviously fat need run around eat hungry others self explanatory new rather interesting vehicles ave been added game hydra harrier type jet stunt plane attack helicopter four wheeler parachute favourite jetpack game like each created before gta graphics fairly modern computer still leave much desired whatever engine clearly same gta animation hand very natural realistic music radio stations lackluster believe possible own music instead computer game san adreas controls very least awkward sheer number actions done worst case scenario hydra however using keyboard fly plane downright nerve racking shoot something below sure compensate couple seconds not moves fast need time angle nose plane direction myself xbox controller has adapter usb port computer not much better still need pad make decent turns tell biggest qualm game overall grand theft auto san andreas has lot offer dont regular gaming console compensated clumsy keyboard controls rate  main appeal grand theft auto franchise has always been freedom gives player explore vast amounts territory cause mayhem sees fit san andreas contains far audacious expansion landmass available time action takes place california inspired locales such los santos san fierro las vegas inspired las venturas within enormous state san andreas main inspiration time around fascination ghetto culture predominant early provides great opportunity rockstar take advantage setting implement new challenges player conquer new grand theft auto concept territory control member street gang player has opportunity take every available territory los santos later game perhaps notable additions franchise ability customize characters appearance improve varied skills throughout game may seem like rather superficial additions surprisingly satisfying implemented properly characters skill growth happens naturally rarely interferes free form exploration players expect series customization avatar varies greatly encompasses fashion styles found during early california lower tier stores offer usual assortment baggy pants sports jerseys while more expensive stores offer suits expensive jewelry trendy fashions characters appearance varied does not stop clothes tattoos physical fitness changed grand theft auto franchise has improved almost aspects each subsequent release proves different last game series outdated engine pushes far terms graphical prowess graphics slightly improved previous installment remain sub par standard featured games released around same time nonetheless visuals quite effective sunsets fill san andreas orange tint games color palette faithfully replicates feel early nineties california culture soundtrack aptly replicates time period san andreas draws visual style perhaps complaint subject rockstar seems try encompass far too many genres music expected genres found such hip hop alternative rock both had strong presence early nineties pop scene however stations seem oddly place game worlds era dance music funk each own stations yet hardly seems worth although too much choice never bad thing making welcomed return various radio station each pepper time between tracks hilarious chat amusing observations those prefer listen nothing banter radio stations talk radio format public station holding discussions days political events another light talk shows either stations more enough keep player amused hours case version gives added bonus playing own tracks adding games music library sound effects themselves seem appropriate never particularly impressive usual banter among pedestrians complaints motorists pull vehicle run off ride things add little bit life games large cities voice varies enough cover different geographical areas san andreas contains thick southern accents countryside inhabitants snobbish tone civilians rich neighborhoods present gunfire explosions sound average not much improvement present since vice city despite controversy seems follow every release series san andreas praiseworthy title itself engrossing action game continues expand limits while continuing deliver fans series expect  cant believe many people saying realistic game not further truth cpu does lob ball down field long plays receiver catches time regardless coverage fun itself highly unrealistic dont started things game does ncaa nothing arcade game realism thrown window does not know meaning difference between levels amount cheating cpu does dont waste money dont make more richer obvious throw games together take money laugh bank  really tried like game being chickened bought competition graphics sound great game ruined ears cheating never seen game cheat much life matter play call defence always knows calling beat play receiver purposely drop wide open pass better yet defender turns notorious oxide installed uniform cover half field seconds deflect pass throw high pass not worry lineman has installed jet packs allows jump feet air deflect pick off pass cpu wants lose lose matter going pass lineman feet away press passing button stand take sack game total off passes heavy pressure game forces tackle animation playing defence better off putting down controller clipping nails flossing teeth while cpu pulls miracle plays every single down remember said receivers purposely drop wide open passes not cpu receivers cpu receivers regardless rating catch passes double triple coverage every time dont catch ball gets tipped over again until catch stopped down conversion again flagged pass interference face mask penalty remember being forced tackle animation not cpu cpu yard spirals while hes being hit inconsistency ask let explain game totally next game cant complete pass ill tell why cpu wants lose drop every pass fumble every run called every penalty book playing game managed run punt before offense touched field sudden cpu turned god mode every thing went right cpu lobs runs calls did not complete single pass entire half not cpu playing good defence receivers dropped every ball thrown wide open not ended completing pass entire game point knew had chance winning started punting ball down avoid more frustration called impact got yards rushes called impact gave passes below average receiver point playing not given chance win yes win games inconsistent cpu wants lose lose nothing why bought license putting crap like were sure lose lot customers game knows develop better instead cheating crap taking game store store credit done good sucks does game  works really problem cable enhanced quality picture much better original cables  need remote turn tele run wont operate dvr dvd vcr cable box youre really keen ill sell mine  change inputs dvd functions functions accessed alternately pressing button tell remote aligned therefore press power button idea powering off xbox things couldnt dumber press eject button while remote mode doesnt eject button designed xbox yet disabled mode option program receiver many others mentioned remote looks nice people designed must been drunk not buy remote unless like wasting money garbage  great cable while playing sony playstation very crisp clear images much better cable comes playstation  component cables make world difference video quality especially hdtv images appear pixelated may game playing everything else smooth crisp clear text three times easy read recommend hdtv owner  playing star wars game made feel very nerdy let tell nerdy rocks game incredible very very fun basically choose side destroy gaining several checkpoints throughout buy game put blasters full  try before buy game has major glitch save game files erased sometimes start again beware  let whole heartily agree review tiberius glory days counter strike game end online video games person shooters games video game basically had real life weapons graphics were superb time maps were extremely made system requirements still obscenely low damn fun inevitably hands time began take ruthless indiscriminate toll video cards supported better graphics new yes better games came battlefield unreal tournament hacking became unmistakable poison counter strike lot cool casual gamers grew moved counter strike went utter joy sensation fading diamond nuisance present has become problem great games great game developers losing tons money people still playing game five years moms worn megahertz pentium iii pcs running windows counter strike still popular games time ridiculous number people playing average people dont seem enough self control hopeless addiction today server admins part humorless dictators not stand anything deviates games undeniable monotonous drone people still playing same maps release completely lost zest initial potential always feels ive played same round thousand times before probably custom maps sickening monotony iceworld fun consecutive seconds many popular custom maps heavy server rotation same disgusting ive played probably servers downloaded probably same amount quality custom maps not more ever seen server run rotation voted players furthermore people still playing game using dial veterans always complaining camping tactic used complete objective far objectives

outstanding won net replaced steam garbage utility soaking wet incompetence speak has gained mass popularity jaded counter strike culture has become own incessant frustration wont youre new dont bother veterans game far friendly youll probably called bunch names involving lots zeroes threes youre beginner indulge yourself great online game check world warcraft battlefield sven team fortress classic dated game awesome community has yet lose initial charm  ill make short sweet went cyber cafe play gem fuss game overrated idea people praise best game world silly game plain average wanna play nice game valve dont need tell ill hint game pure garbage online boring dont need flaming bashing cause mans opinion differs yours good visuals good gustatory mediocerplain boring combat nothing new online isnt great extremity overrated trust gets boring awhile yes played more hour bucks ill never stars extremity overrated not worth bucks thats got peac  denying star wars battlefront best video game series currently available game really amazing let participate places seen six movies though game really fun felt like something still missing missing piece put result not disappointment best unlike game main story game play capturing bases killing enemy forces here actually missions complete having retrieve data discs killing rebel leaders game more depth predecessor game still times bases captured like game longer kill enemies coolest part game ride different ships things movies lots fun overall game really improvement may prefer more reason being game basically kill everyone take bases less seen here focus more protecting things stealing things  hands down best star wars game played seen fact almost every hero villain star wars movies makes blast play addition space combat really tips scales title youre flying through waves tie fighters land imperial star destroyer begin fighting through control rooms begin realize game really special  game really good theres wide variety levels play very good multiplier system game has few faults like blown frigate space sometimes goes through capital ship game gets little boring while besides great game  person shooter battle through star wars battles through episodes fighting soldiers republics side chance play jedi has more power normal soldier opportunity instant action where choose battlefield pick side fight choose conquer galaxy really boring game really fun starts boring awhile friends play multi player split screen yoda awesome  looking xbox version another chapter mechwarrior series isnt extremely dumbed down version mechwarrior fans forget having customization remember fire weapon time cycle between lazers cannons rockets bored minutes again people never played series may like game better  opening cut scene introduces blinx cat supporting cast particulars upcoming adventures found myself trying wrap brain around basic premise story idea secret off world clan humanoid cat creatures armed souped vacuum cleaners responsible development dispersal time itself every known plane existence map seems time compressed tightly enough transported said cats takes form five different brightly colored shapes crystals left open too long without being properly introduced flow things turn monsters game certainly doesnt stop point like theres fairly thick line drawn between cartoony fantasy super detailed realism generally lot physics environmental details taken granted realistic game theyre almost exclusively set photo realistic lifelike location cartoons hand generally dont worry themselves particulars primarily concerned delivering good time much fun wile coyote cartoons every time lead character suffered grisly fate strictly obeyed laws gravity aerodynamics blinx tries straddle thick line delivering story thats overly detail centric environment thats right kids show result tale comes off left field almost completely abstract focuses things better left viewers imagination ignores importance good underlying story along beneath needless discussions why monsters world time compression works cats actually responsible hold dear actual plot almost laughably straightforward generic theres princess evil pigs kidnapped you rescue save world thats side stories reasoning subplots straightforward rush point point here thought phrase save princess universally recognized ages old cliche dont sound like railing game got few more nit picky details peers reuses old phrase plat former handbook sole driving factor completely lacking character development general storytelling ongoing inspiration none characters blinx really establish themselves individuals including lead character himself dont hate pig spaceship hes trying destroy world hate every time shows tries steal money honestly forgot princess end game level three shes never mentioned between games start finish mean very super mario brothers least reminded princess another castle end every boss fight dont honestly game really designed enjoyable much geared overly challenging level half set standard know format simplest enemies routine stage layouts plenty opportunities mess around tools shortly thereafter youre thrown wolves part level designs very short more emphasis cheap hits complexity true challenge noticed lot overlap stage layouts whether retracing steps time time again walking along catwalk har har above beginning stage invariably plummeting start point youll almost always know needs done actually accomplishing act real trick cant overemphasize unbearably cheap game really theres bottomless pit nearby chances very good blinx find force himself regardless youre hitting control pad theres enemy feet front you hit attack button hell aim random switch side room rather imminent threat thats not entirety time sweeper totally without merit does bring few fresh ideas table part those insights hampered surroundings ability control time instance time really fresh interesting new play mechanic still stands today despite limited field imitators since emerged rewind few seconds catch enemy unaware rebuild crumbling bridge pause action take advantage frozen time knock level slow motion etc while blinx moving around real time great idea implementation painfully short underutilized why cant controls same time why dont more aspects stage encourage player experiment solve problems powers why doesnt ridiculous ten minute stage time limit pause speed rewind time powers why duration brief why cant hold more dozen uses time mean really been fantastic experience time control aspect had been beefed little further treated more auxiliary function otherwise run mill platformer controls too undeveloped under tested nightmare blinx himself often sluggish respond especially implementing time controls has difficulty making precise turn whether midair solid ground stops briefly celebrate gaining item leaves open constant enemy attacks routinely moves direction certain death though pulled magnetic field whether youve instructed not hell occasionally refuse perform double jump particularly attempting difficult precise leap across gaping chasm controls make blinx mind squashing aggravating glance youd imagine theyd fairly difficult screw youve got jump button suction fire button time control button analog stick control movement plus had already been long established line three dimensional platforms market years before titles release paving ideal control experience super mario had issues sure nothing like trailblazer entire genres jump world like had map leading right treasure decided forge own path anyway cant impressed graphics showcased throughout time sweeper either exception lead character himself incredibly cheesy preschool ish character designs feel unfinished hurried less purposeful youd imagine especially contrast blinx himself particularly insulting large population simple blobs roam around levels trying vain bump cause fatal injury heres finely detailed main character such close attention paid wardrobe gloss shoes obviously debated time time again hes pitted against set monsters sprung life directly pages four olds sketchbook despite featuring spoken dialog track theres english voice acting couldnt pinpoint language wife seems either french close variation certainly didnt sound japanese while does add touch personality title not every chance hear cat shouting something language love seemed really odd place coming television everyones vocal personalities black white too feel like great chance establish much needed individuality among cast lost once again here bad guys same deep gravelly transparently evil tone while good guys bright cheery squeaky high pitched like monkeys super monkey ball like parody games had before wont developers enough credit assume were doing purpose overall blinx really few promising concepts thrown together package strapped shell far below average third person platformer unleashed upon unsuspecting public time release still need lot polishing serious scrutiny behind closed doors evaluation far concepts half hear ted character designs conceivably stretched without losing quality top really dont know audience were targeting game ridiculously difficult betrays childlike demeanor surrounds leads believe meant serious gamers bright kid friendly annoyingly cutesy cant imagine anyone demographic rushing stores release number spontaneous controller hurls shot through roof during time blinx reaching near marvel cap com levels unashamed excruciatingly cheap hits especially later levels idea acquired willpower finish level eight game adequately lengthy offers replay value hidden cat medals each stage eventually unlocking production sketches promotional materials like once start hunting floating cat heads those super tough later levels though youll remember why were happy finished place unless feel like pulling hair clumps shaved head experience part cleansing process enjoy self mutilation recommend stay far away  bought daughter loves sing didnt idea fun whole family join play hours fun immediately had buy kareoke cmt country game  hate game worst game ive ever played  game great group friends really breaks ice between anybody may not familiar incredibly entertaining suggest game everybody  bought game adult birthday party hit game very entertaining easy navigate through game full control settings such music level vocals crowd noise etc change mode traditional karaoke words displayed screen definitely ages old cant enough selection music good sure memory card save characters create keep track performance unlock hidden treasures such extra songs wardrobes  karaoke revolution game received enjoy very much however songs game found were quite old someone like myself senior college dont know rest were blur didnt know songs very put major hindrance game play liked high amount songs put recent game already ordered karaoke revolution volume seeing more recent songs know found sing dance mode challenging dont know song heart dont play need watching arrows where feet should going recommend wireless microphone dance pad exist since cord dancing moves thought really cool game had sense initiative different unlockable items although items create character new character songs listed here need unlocked through

like youre best friend take  excited game loved godfather russia love hype surrounding game incredible actual game however incredibly disappointing driving controls especially compared driving controls godfather awful having much trouble driving kept looking through handbook doing something wrong saw using controller supposed missions involve driving under specific time limit awful controls gave early too frustrating musical play list control fun liked more free roaming like godfather looking forward hearing everyones voices were opening credits dale earnhardt since almost totally given guess wont hear voice acting talent does anyone know plan release xbox maybe control issues worked before game had much potential right not living  dont know extoll praises game loudly enough plugged christmas morning entire family friends been playing ever since selection songs excellent sing dance feature brings sends game front earlier editions eye toy good addition everything rate cant single drawback suggestion purchase game make experience entire family parents too  every has game adapted classic movie based classic movie russia love actually not bad game recently landing hands copy simply couldnt resist picking scarface world yours loved movie scar face gonna love turns didnt controls really joke instead normal fps rpg etc really bland controls cant tell dialogue corny everything else joke die hard fans guess  few outfits new furniture not lot free stuff download sims stuff pack not very worth maxi milking franchise every penny  game recommend without reservation anyone looking adventure game beautiful positive entrancing funny inventive has great soundtrack doesnt involve violence carnage completely under spell game weeks weeks old son equally engaged able complete without help himself needed help boss battles anything under time pressure lose hours game wont emerge tense sore shoulders anxiety frustration impossible tasks same time definitely not too easy challenging enough long thank goodness didnt end overall tone positive japanese wolf goddess romping through detailed beautifully imagined executed japanese watercolor world weapons take monsters weapon ink brush take monsters calligraphy strokes simply brilliant make excellent christmas gift adventure game lover  noticed were not many new items game found advertising game deceiving expansion not worth money  downloading objects fan sites hit miss had many collections ive downloaded incorrectly not next expansion pack items really liked were suddenly unavailable looking forward stuff pack maxis bah yes several very nice items really underwhelming collection whole items very limited collections small pictures cover good portion contained like many here remarked money spent not equal value received another reviewer pointed title glamour life implies jewelry house items luxurious textures floors walls clothing ages excess abundance theres abundance here ive found items like not impressed collection maxis knows target audience always hungry new items taking advantage fact fooling thinking getting much more actually recieve money feel little cheated must wait until price drops better yet find good reputable fan site very good ones safe downloads download small fee free  cant enough okami ive beaten started second play though action rpg game fan has least try game title basically says typically japanese play words since depending translate okami mean either wolf king gods those people whom not enough information really understand game here basics years before games beginning huge headed dragon monster called orochi menaced small village kamiki suffering orochis tyranny years villages champion nagi white wolf village dubbed shiranui defeated orochi shiranui died wounds fight village built shrine peace reigned years until evil suddenly mysteriously reappeared control shiranui reborn quest save land evil travel land nippon japanese japan original fighting monsters helping people healing nature curse evil story nothing new both very linear quite predictable very done mixing japanese mythology classic hero story generous helping humor flavor story has major downside though told through cut scenes contain bucket loads exposition often find yourself button mashing desperately try speed things along does not very important cut scenes dont let speed dialogue instance very cut scene opens game literally takes least minutes through before action rest not nearly long several take good minutes least gets tedious understatement still cell shaded graphics largely make tedious cut scenes done very beautiful yet simplistic style evokes traditional japanese ink painting despite simple style though level detail outstanding fact detailed occasional spot graphical slowdown game really pushes hardware limits music sound fantastic music evokes traditional japanese art much graphics while sound effects range wolf barks footfalls wind blowing gently through trees more mood always set perfectly whatever environment youre visiting except possibly voices rather real voices people talk form gibberish sounds like someone trying talk underwater while does not bother personally people simply not listen voice effects either youll hate voice noises passion wont care either not good point game controls take bit getting used gotten used become second nature unlike legend zelda games enemy lock during combat instead automatically target closest monster push attack button simplifies combat without turning button mashing cake walk works perfectly unless hit controller bug yes bug game thankfully rare encountered twice hours game play still happens extremely annoying during combat while youre wailing away monster options menu suddenly open reason usually analog control controller crazy either turning off madly flickering off either case makes game impossible play course since control game avatar left analog stick case easy fix turn analog control exit menu second case fix literally unplugging controller plugging far more common controller bug load times usually not terrible seems like loading screen comes least every five minutes between long cut scenes might sometimes wonder actually game play included game play lot fun great deal keep occupied compelling story line many treasure hunts races puzzles mini games between fighting save world fishing feed animals catch thieves lot more plus beat game once unlocks lots extras including image galleries sound track wonderful atmosphere definitely make game worth checking rent before buy possible make sure deal long cut scenes numerous load times weird voice effects fan action rpgs like legend zelda definitely add okami game library summary pros great story great

hundred years dispatch evil thats overtaken land entire landscape bleak dead affected evil task both fight ultimate evil restore land using various techniques learn throughout game really interesting aspects game since main character folk tale deity form wolf player affect environment game drawing calligraphy brush circle stroke sky creates sun turn night another stroke across dead tree brings bursting full bloom slashing stroke across enemies cuts minor complaint far perhaps does little too much shepherding terms letting know where next however doesnt detract game overall same time player does good deal freedom havent felt railroaded through story line perhaps extra guidance make game more accessible people arent usually gamers youre looking something visually interesting occasionally humorous very different game play usual fare okami highly recommended  where heck vince young matt leinart reggie bush version reggie bush cover youre going opportunity play heisman trophy winner pair lendale white matt leinart take longhorns try replay rose bowl none players found fact ohio state listed team behind times sports does football games need buy ncaa order players prime hoping able play updated abilities reflect outstanding years ideas code cheat need unlock help  reading word review dave jeanclerc strongly disagree points review has nothing box version apparently awesome playing football games since mid sick paying same game every games owns rights college nfl teams wont football games game companies note ably sega revolutionized football simulation games late ncaa football basically same ncaa football each adds little tweak mix overall same same feel same moves same everything theyve changed kick ball added more defensive audibles thats few minor adjustments none worth noting imo fact audibles added exact same audibles used segas espn football call audibles individual defensive players thieves everything else exact same disappointing thing graphically speaking crowd still looks like flat rows objects moving unison like did games made years ago big change improved momentum meter thought ridiculous last wait til play ncaa momentum meter has such strong influence game make offensive mistake beginning game youre doomed thats cant win example played fsu twice time made half errors pounded hurricanes played same exact settings same stadium again purposely fumbled opening kickoff giving hurricanes ball line lost game fumble mistake game nessler herbstriet corso still making same exact game comments were saying gimme break still atrocious defensively computer controlled team hapless blitz every down fact ive lined numerous times long receivers defence continually loads men box dont put enough dbs stop basically game long bombs choose team good receivers easily throw yards game continually going deep safeties always blitz safeties drop coverage does computer counteract deep balls easy momentum meter swings against favor receivers drop every ball throw hit chest ball finally decide run ball running fumbles ball immediately played game between usc cal kept switching play team didnt momentum ended turning ball every possession may reading saying hey guy has played game lot figure not really exactly ive played game same glitches ive encountered too has really dropped ball again paying updated rosters typical fashion dont names players different skill levels games suck soccer games horrible basketball games too slow awkward dont update football games guarantee madden same madden watch has gone box editions ncaa ans madden sure those versions stunning rest paying same price last years game  typical box game using checkpoints instead creativity make challenging nothing more mind numbing doing same thing over again keep getting killed right before next checkpoint granted hours hours playing time something havent already done times before highly recommend game people intellect enjoy working production lines where same thing repeatedly brain actually requires kind stimulation find more creative game addition actions tend bit uncooperative times such attempting knock someone instead stand waiting shot apparently arent facing perfect position attempting smash brains stand like manakin hoping guy inches front doesnt notice another option try shoot unless head shot expect fire gobs rounds take since seem armed short pistol  looked game store wasnt real sure totally surprised got home tried starts slow prepare has greatest story line add great graphics wonderful characters easy learn controls put together okami avid gamer love types mainly enjoy action adventure old mother enjoy sitting down kids kicking butt game coarse much fun together know alto people down video games general spend quality time kids anyway game absolute

japanese legend dealing sun god amaterasu play form white wolf epic quest awaits truly sets okami apart rest pack calligraphy esque celestial brush must advance throughout game need bridge draw need dispatch pesky enemy draw half brush adds new dynamic game play fresh unique makes wonder why has ever tried anything like before game type theres loads side quests mini games adding length okami truly make epic game help make best games ever theres anything bad okami combat too easy spots extremely minor gripe okami thing owners been waiting yearning original epic adventure doesnt stale provides unique mouth watering graphics youll ever own okami absolute must own best games youll ever play  overall impression game made rush assuming good alignment win simply building expensive buildings edge influence zone burning enemys platoons sent very unintelligent since winning requires strategy game challenging basically same levels races against fights pretty much same except skins buildings aspect defeating takes hours game play unlike previous version custom campaigns nor multi player features cinematics creature apart looks like very primitive version age empires  game itself very interesting story line engaging controls unique rpg quite switch mario major problem game interactivity not enough specifically far too many cut scenes not stoppable many cut scenes lead directly boss battle frustrating instance before final boss battle takes minutes real fight prior save point isnt problem time through sequence lose times becomes hassle makes game not really worth playing end major problem game designers found around nintendo revealed lack rpg experience element interesting game make sure win friend sibling enemy skip through dialog sequences tired them  game not everyone

obviously not fully tested before released whenever more enemies screen game has horrible clipping graphic slowdown issues means bad guys keep shooting guy doesnt respond quickly commands clipping bad sometimes wanted find ceo activision shove game down throat fun game dont play version borrow someones box play version another example greedy developer rushing port market without bothering make sure

story not buy game  such great visuals love star wars rpg shooters cant believe point click game hoping kotor implemented normal battle engagement theres nothing worse toggling through menus etc during intense battle actually having turn around click target engage someone else kill days boulders gate point click should guess theres crowd type game play still good game disappointed  lucas should ashamed stamp name turkey not play box experience random sound shrieks resolution issues too long load times overall really buggy perplexing product why very good  bought game thought great game wrong dont light sabre until far game advertisements shows light sabre game extremely buggy has poor graphics huge star wars fan not recommend game anyone matter big star wars fan dont buy game  off ive read secret old clock made game more boring knew basic outline above review adult age loved understand found game overly boring puzzles were too easy driving around horribly done car part game

meaning couldnt progress past point problem time didnt not saying bad game probably not good game grownups  game new experience didnt like did like story telling keeps interested overall interesting fun entertain  sure graphics sound nice game very linear very forgiving too forgiving save reload constantly long arent monsters nearby things made kinda dummy proof cant make significant mistakes result never really felt like taking much chance doing anything dialogue mostly matter clicking responses until cant click anymore theres not much bad consequence clicking order theres really path through different areas game nothing ever spawns adjust difficulty levels very easy very difficult experience treasure dont adjust accordingly means fight too tough couple reloads make very easy still same rewards gotten hard yawn maybe little jaded playing online games like ever quest long online real time games humans playing around much more unpredictable more importantly uncontrollable much more exciting environment play got bored actually stopped playing while close completing very last area game didnt care anymore game requires very little thinking stargazing  paper idea video game sounds like great idea upon glance seems like firing cylinders featuring major players series reprising roles kiefer sutherland dennis haysbert elisa cuthbert etc storyline tone atmosphere captures feel show game falls apart once further missions repetitive animation graphics jumpy glitched controls unresponsive least targeting enemies chore times analog sticks targeting along plain moving gets incredibly cumbersome thanks camera seems against forgive able further through more rushed game feels shame too considering innovative series early life everything game had going more polish put game been something special recommended rental fans series  guess thing ill got jedi academy before got game hugely disappointed really liked jedi academy game not great cheat codes weapons ammo undying parts game insanely tough many puzzles dont mind puzzles simply many insanely hard recommend jedi knight jedi academy better puzzles arent insane choose like ill leave aired jedi academy another star

take dongle dvd screen telling reinsert either dongle remote slightly injured malfunction youve wasted thirty bucks feel quite ripped off low cost dvd nowadays much better idea buy standalone imho

quite time before figured mystery however game took days nancy drew games kept intrigued kept coming more game breezed and quite disappointed fact words end game were thats interactive better more interesting game next time youll lose interest  seems like hurried game too much running around answers phone did not web access actually did not like all  daughter played previous games weve enjoyed overall games fantastic challenging fun game quite lame comparison others puzzles werent really puzzling boring tasks were not many clues find werent many clues real sense detecting anything game ended abruptly very short did not walk through solve mystery record time experienced lack challenge did like newness becoming frank joe hardy occasionally rest pretty boring looking nancy drew game try others instead  review bovey spot games gotten more boring majority game spent looking same shells over make same necklaces over much enough real sense scariness danger boredom game short suddenly ended disappointed games become loved final scene liked blackmoor manor though never finished without consulting walk through game lame dont recommend paying full price  seriously hold finger close camera lens wave forth perfect cheating game not bad  ive been fan games since secrets kill came ive played not sure whats happened games though while graphics steadily improved puzzles plot game play really gone downhill game secrets kill had pretty horrific graphics story compelling were fabulous puzzles things really picked second game stay tuned danger better graphics very interesting story very cool puzzles great plot absolutely recommend games stay tuned danger message haunted mansion treasure royal tower final scene secret scarlet hand ghost dogs moon lake danger deception island secret shadow ranch games similar length interesting puzzles lots areas where snoop around really enjoy game haunted carousel interesting has wonderful graphics awfully short did not enjoy curse blackmoor manor found too difficult cannot really recommend secret old clock too short repetitive did somewhat enjoy last train blue moon canyon danger design were nowhere near quality earlier games terms plot puzzles outstanding graphics too short amount repetition puzzles order advance drove completely crazy dont mind nancy running doing errands help people thought games had perfectly balanced like each task different interesting not mind numbingly repetitive boring seems factor more recent games delivering telegrams game painting pictures game finding seashells making necklaces game miss

minutes including credits cannot break move set down psp grab drink find short battle play story characters long annoying conversations press end each sentances again break game menu manage game through each painfully slow dialog box until chapter game really bad maybe gets little more interesting possible actually something besides watch characters argue really slow storyline dialog does not appear foreplay played type game before enjoy style play might like bored frustrated minute  pretty much sums felt minutes introductory waffle hellishly annoying bingy bongy music admittedly very pretty cut scenes totally emotionless voice overs impossibly slow conversations served little point honest point either switch off psp throw against wall decided switch off big fan adventure games played untold legends till gave literally left hanging around nothing more quests offer gather game graphics valkyrie minutes though seemed like much longer seen really cool character graphics bit like taken game graphics those horrible munchkin japanese rpg graphics game stuff bit play looks like years old should gab cut scenes nice doubt far too many those minutes slow cut scenes every encounter cant proper review couldnt stand title long enough actual game play theres sitting through intro again advice like long winded old style walk talk three hours before actually doing anything japanese rpgs better still antiques shop find old text adventure prefer game where actually play character stuff avoid like plague ive got high hopes dungeon siege comes had high hopes valkyrie too untold legends okay not good should been helluva lot more fun valkyrie like point ive never played box game cube time ive seen valkyrie profile game didnt preconceptions obviously had never gone anywhere near title place  lemony game not hardcore gamers doesnt aspire shouldnt compared warcraft resident evil game developed amaze activision familiar three harry potter movie ordinates games

golden eyes golden hearts refuel stamina instead chocolate frogs playbills letters granted instead wizard cards players recognize flavor wonderful score game set enjoyable appropriate not overbearing familiar notes lemony isnt quite good aforementioned potter games reason being lemony not fun story while fictitious lemony story relentless abuse three very droll very wealthy orphans much more fun play boy has left abusive aunt uncle behind entering magical world educated hogwarts rather enjoyed learning fly buckbeak prisoner exurban lemony rather relieved solved train signal puzzle thought having children run over train until did depressing yet lemony provide consolation those been disappointed eas latest potter offering goblet fire while adjustment droll circumstances task discovering world take game eventually command attention while lemony isnt bad isnt good either renderings children not flattering villains boorishly ugly game play controls arent half good potter games werent

lemony three times third time going through motions once few skills jumping aiming egg lobber boot puncher had been mastered wasnt interest left time did play did enjoy games amaze category unto themselves not action games based trigger finger nor point click boring adventure games beset brain teaser puzzles futuristic world relaxing time where dont test brain delight never played potter games new gaming recommend lemony good place start fellow potterhead felt betrayed buy goblet fire lemony sustain  memory cards came exactly advertised worked great read errors very noticeable increased speed load time compared card types recommend anyone looking value pack memory cards worth  love idea behind game pretty impressively executed had three gripes though fast paced found really difficult progress past third procedure couldnt magnify reduce quick little circles caused great frustration theres skip through seemingly endless pages character dialogue repeat procedure couple times quit playing pretty quickly  love card childrens own games  had purchased pack memory card pretty good problems memory card  best memory cards sony playstation memory card rumors spread non sony memory cards damage lose saves memory cards  wow game freaking cool colossi amazing ive played share games honestly ive never encountered creatures like before halfway through game having slain colossi more yet yet each new colossus meet astounds again thing never felt games invoke sympathy towards until find own little area world giant hulks resting peacefully bothering once disturbed awaken must figure take each down actually feel sad fall supposedly character must take down resurrect lifeless lover however sense twist story before ends another equally awe inspiring aspect game environment playing without compare beautiful mystical unbelievably gorgeous landscape ive seen game ever world looks feels sounds like ancient place time experience those games ill remember years today play again game art certain films plus freaking cool dont miss  game mind numbingly hard not very challenging rather set fail missions thrust situation little indication patients vital signs drops frantically poke trying nurse assists gives vague ideas before know youve failed mission take average failures before finally won mission last mission played made quit resulted failures thats being hour half game graphics crisp clear storyline didnt make much impression probably too frustrated pay attention game had lot potently killed constantly making fail not buy game unless extreme amount patients game collector keep sealed youre gultton punishment whatever not buy game hype does not live  game has stunning graphics fast paced game play game simply killing different bosses over again dont trying make game sound bad kind battles game like make game awesome example every colossus different looking has different ways kill each lot more complicating others threes many colossus takes long time beat overall game great  game seriously disappointing disappointing didnt finish second case before setting down forever highly entertained cute funny going around clicking things new user highly entertaining however quickly got older cant skip through horrendously long dialog ever youve heard million times youre clicking people hopelessly frustration unable figure found myself looking internet walk through yes simplistic game couldnt figure click wandering around hopelessly thirty minutes reading dialog youve read thousand times gets too frustrating typical patience level possible spoiler seemed glitch second story talked wrong person wrong time never ticket planetarium couldnt take more gave places people never change each case understanding exact same tiny few places not big gamer like world bigger three feet let friend borrow thus far enjoying more help review college age female gaming console although ive played quite bit maybe really hit miss dont really recommend anyone someone high patience level really high patience level  pros awesome graphics huge world explore great story line easy play you kill colossal enemies cons all kill colossi real side quests except power ups replay try battle attack  icon game very different others focused puzzle solving had short unforgettable story mixed fantastic visuals audio imagine icon action were incorporated something like shadow colossus ecos prequel sotc colossal achievement many different levels presentation stand front deceased woman whose identity unknown told defeating colossi roam land may able revive may price sets shroud mystery surrounds sotc start journey given nothing bows arrows sword trusty horse agro graphics land sometimes colorful supposed desolate wont much life here real kudos goes animation occurs during boss bottles different motion blur affects really bring game new level realism agros animation cinema worthy game play meat potatoes sotc game play ride steed direction colossus begin battle bars grip strength health grip determines long hold things such colossi themselves best part game play isnt done hands mind each colossus puzzle must solved determining weak spot thing colossus varied each keep guessing next while hard funnest experiences youve ever had audio same tracks repeated throughout here never grow old music seems match mood youve met colossus youll hear soft music while figure music rise mount beast pieces here sound good great pieces overall youve beaten picked jaw off ground surprise ending not yet time attack mode hard mode used collect few unlockables while such modes seem trivial did mention extremely fun experience had through again absolutely brain shadow colossus now  gamecube weak owned both nes nintendo those were excellent gaming systems nintendos recent system gamecube has several problems design internal fan slow quiet hour system overheats thus shuts down second problem wireless controllers system suck tried brands none worked more week brands tried pelican intec nintendo osmart third problem system not built last still nes nintendo both great doubt gamecube last past years simply put dont buy product nintendo wii going soon description specs need stand interact move around stuff game sounds fun like hard something like sony eye toy  game fun injoyable bonus levels questionable almost better less people  hesitated good while before picking game bargain price based upon various reviews player feedback assumed game like hours long bit buggy dumbed down fortunately none case had good fun weekend yes finished weekend didnt across single bug fable not same league morrowind oblivion gothic great role playing games rpg does provide enjoyable diversion game play controls typical wasd keys mouse commands found single player rpgs game fairly easy learn navigate story traces hero childhood through adulthood hell know save world character classes per roughly play warrior magic user stealth archer character mixture much story centers around main quest line number side quests available unlike rpgs quests assigned quest cards pick heroes guild lol thats actually called rather artificial feeling system functional progression game quite linear instances not able leave beaten patch since fences rocks invisible barriers wont allow compared more open ended rpgs like elder scrolls series fable seems restrictive light weight regard overall decent story rather force fed game includes several interesting touches people react based upon whether youve performed good bad deeds role play like saint youll eventually halo butterflies floating around ladies guys worship option buy home marry multiple times youd like play evil character youll eventually grow horns fall favor polite company nonplayer characters game least towns jobs schedules during sleep night though quest related characters anything interest although play game same guy customize tattoos facial hair haircuts small assortment armour control characters skills develop not deeply game like morrowind baldurs gate small things such fish play games chance treasure hunt overall game takes hours everything has offer rather short rpg things didnt much care not major simply underscore light weight nature particular game game certainly designed appeal adolescent crowd hotkeys burping farting forth various tattoo styles haircuts further highlight point nothing really offensive game feels bit immature places save system based mostly checkpoint model cant save anywhere least quest progress not save game auto save important junctures graphics game looks quite good character models convincing though bit cartoon ish often repeated natural environment screen shot beautiful places since pathing fairly restrictive much scenery non interactive not like oblivion gothic where probably travel sounds voice acting pretty good usual british accents invariably seem accompany such games music particularly done appropriate various atmospheres ambient sounds decent replayability technical issues game probably worth playing twice once good guy once bad guy play similarly either different ways perform certain quests depending moral disposition technically game perfectly stable computer freezes crashes problems manual decent explains much game along game tutorial like rpg games cheap polished though simple rump through fairly rendered world dont expect same character depth engrossing story exploring options youll find games mentioned above however fable lost chapters good several hours entertainment  came box incredibly angry had silly gameboy came computer had found game very fun play simple controls arrows not wads felt very fulfilled credits finally rolled last battle doesnt take long finish game play continuous watch entire credits always start switch evil good side new version game  huge fan rpg genre played every morrow ind boring ever played turned off evenings

created enemies gets boring real quick button mashing galore repetitive game play destructable environments seem like good plus youll soon learn much actually against brawl becomes more frustrating should cumbersome control scheme adds not mention controls quite buggy graphics sharp distance game has odd like doesnt know wants like spider man ultimate spider man both great games much more worth time game cut scenes godawful few saving graces save marvel nemesis being complete clunker including horde unlock able content comic fans love marvel heroes super powers nicely pulled off including storms weather attacks daredevils agility online support where fun game had though theres not much else here hold interest youre looking great super hero game check men legends series aforementioned

cant where else hate  recommend not buying game unless dont mind buggy version not supported hasbro cant fixed hasbro has decided not support game patches website longer available save money wait next hopefully bug free  isnt whole lot add reviews disagree game challenging bought game week ago ive already beaten guide internet valkyries cheats honestly thats never been case gta game ive played heck still trying beat san andreas play straight cheats guides helpers ive had game ending kind cheesy too still good game makes great pacifier until next gta comes cant really wrong anyway  bought game week ago had not purchased prequel game did not know expect began playing game immediately got bored minutes later played game since heres why graphics ridiculously annoying makes game feel unrealistic graphics step lower nba street more unrealistic real problem nothing enter tournaments feel same little side missions laughable feel like turning off smashing controller head repetitively every time play why hated game wont bottom line strongly urge not waste money cover appearance game appealed made buy game dont let happen you  playing game third time had thought why did buy game extremely unoriginal gets boring very quickly cannot notice difference improvements balers nba streets save money not purchase dreadful game  liberty city like gta cant fly swim clime like gta graphics upgrade airplanes glitches like crazy same pps looking game play fun enjoy int resting funny good story line bucks cant wrong  grand theft auto series playstation gone hand hand each game debuting before travels consoles changed release last years side story grand theft auto liberty city stories game designed take advantage psps hardware impressive technical feat managing pack lot made big gta games memorable fell short few key spots notably story characters series biting sense style satire stuff easy overlook carry liberty city around pocket where compare directly three grand theft auto games appeared whole package significantly less interesting considering ports budget price not much has changed youve already played psp theres not much reason take version games got slightly longer draw distance playstation streets like might few more people neither things dramatically changes game cant save games otherwise murky visuals often poor frame rate controls little better right analog stick effect youve got camera control buttons youre used hitting neither elegant nor particularly noteworthy didnt play psp liberty city stories price tag right dont expecting anything approaching grandiose nature gtaiii let alone bigger crazier vice city san andreas youve already played psp theres little reason play again same game multiplier modes stripped return liberty city new york themed locale made famous grand theft auto iii liberty city stories retreading through worn territory still remember streets liberty city youll plenty same spots here game designed less powerful psp youll probably notice liberty city stories much smaller scope weve seen series more recently missions grew epic proportions san andreas much shorter feel pretty meaningless lcd plenty moments where youll complete mission immediately least ill never again story however biggest casualty liberty city stories tells tale toni cyprian regular type mob guy did good deed head leone crime family salvatore leone toni had away awhile heats died down hes job liberty city maintaining loyalty sal while wiping familys enemies droves along ascend become salvatores right hand man youll start finish gang wars mafia types few triads yakuza pretty much usual suspects present youre familiar various mafia presences course past three gta games youll recognize few names faces here story stands alone doesnt require remember various cast members thats good thing mafia characters gta games been largely forgettable games storyline really isnt par console installments series very little actually happens potential plot points squandered like toni finally becomes made man bad cutscene doesnt actually show ceremony games mission path doesnt deviate crazy territory characters fairly lifeless enigmatic weirdos like truth crazy hippie san andreas steve scott porno director vice city break heavier handed mafia tasks dulls games personality preventing characters events becoming memorable weve expect gta games excellent storylines  games story takes place before gta sort like equal set liberty city compared original looks lot better plus added bikes motor cycles attempted improve targeting using targeting system san andreas hate targeting being able target manually good thing dont own psp suggest getting game played system really isnt point buying game unless really really love gta  bought same time did ten kaitos origins dont hold original comes close tell square had hands liked style graphics very impressive dont really fit game play star overall comes again battle system holds true button controls character movement system needs uses full range system like star ocean changes attack view fighting similar original ultimate magic those really awesome super moves still intact not far game already characters original star here thats arngrim lezard valeth cool were favs cant wait characters make valkyrie profile hrist like return hand drawn sprites riddence movement system  poor quality box play almost useless very dis pointed sell game  never played original dont really game such treasure find phenomonal music graphics engrossing game play twisted plot variety characters possible play lost lot sleep game not half done anything has best show graphics seen something expect square enix production wind moving through environments water trickling sort dream like haze towns culminates eye pleaser nothing else game play game engineering top quality character designs very diverse many periods time cultures represented fairly mix female male characters classes like archers light warriors mages ect menu navigation ability load different game data anytime combat serious perk many take granted keep loading game dont einherjar until randomized selection gives perfect group looking adventure ability instantly travel location map without lengthy travel location location keeps pace nice brisk giving buying equipment battles difficulty right where needs quick run game tough time beating boss nice not leveling forced rather elective thing through story battles clever mixing tactical rpg action making very engaging actually fun degree button mashing again not static boring turn turn cast spell drink potion actually combat like should cant praise game enough dont care good cant better certainly down best title had complaints recycled voice commentary different einherjar fact really arent involved main story line since stupid not make third customizable armour been cream crop solid offering last has offer  gripe customer said were differences between disk versions information false time origional release fortunate high end computer time able run windows version had much better graphics character illustrations beyond upset found nothing dos version bought play windows version knowlage does not past win maybe those played been waiting play windows version very upset  loved game child spent many hours playing incredibly excited able play laptop oops didn update drivers games kings quest minutes playing cant screen due graphic errors patches available yet dosnt like feel pretty ripped off says cover big print runs windows barely not very does interested game check vivendi has done patches before buy disapointed better yet download fan made editions free online work  experience developer tri aces games dates original playstation era star ocean story like gamers side world probably tri ace titles had created enough buzz form niche fans game credited similar yet bigger buzz original valkyrie profile unfortunately yield initial pressing run game low tri ace wouldnt lose much game didnt sell catch time had heard hype surrounding wanted game try much too late copies game were selling astronomical prices bay much like sealed copies final fantasy vii selling ecstatic sequel case actually prequel announced finally experience had missed time form another granted not complete carbon copy original majority game play elements cross game generation gap essence game should probably idea original itself like blown away impressed missed missing original not really start game simply beautiful dazzling effects leaves grass waving breeze various types weather pounding locals should expect last generation title sure every once while battle camera might clip polygons looks like characters standing air minor doesnt matter gripe wish characters weapons changed depending currently equipped however since character designs dependant default weaponry above simply wouldnt very combat valkyries claim fame much like tri ace games like star ocean good thing considering amount time youll spend battle mode leveling games massive number characters handful actually involved story others seem quick glance battle system seems button mashers dream like good fighting series soul caliber taken those know doing always further less difficulty things difficult enough combat related issues sprout reviving ally requires near allys body status effects not friend especially whole party inflicted once especially poison shutter fun combat quite few hitches aware such wasting dash getting nowhere party caught edge something environment party members become separated same reason limiting attack options until take time becomes especially aggravating youre trying finish battles quickly efficiently possible receive experience crystal bonuses change fighting environment works above issues make yearn battles original probably devoid problems games skill system another area initially seems interesting clever quickly becomes quite cumbersome youll form rune words equipment accessories unlock new potential skills note word potential previous sentence unlocking new skill doesnt grant character skill automatically though battle skill used permanently learned glance good thing since prevents abuse ffix skill system here player quickly finds may usually take long learn said skill instead being awarded set amount points towards skills enemy defeat like normal rpgs percentage earned towards potential skills based average level current party enemy youll constantly seeking stronger stronger enemies youll hardly ever find undeniable great place level youll contending never ending equipping equipping equipment while doing often means party usually far wearing strongest available equipment times something usually given rpgs traversing dungeons probably noteworthy aspect battle system few complete cakewalk teach ropes later ones really test sanity brainpower correct sealstone usage photon know long towards completely clearing contents kudos tri ace awesome auto map feature features like need become industry genre standard sound department motoi sakuraba makes rather subdued yet solid entrance seeming ditch rather unique yet unorthodox style composing not until much later until hear piece know yeah thats sakuraba doubt voice overs good same time few tiers above decent valkyrie profile falls victim problems prevalent tri ace games moments unbalanced game play creep player difficulty goes few notches without much warning story once again slow start surprise anymore tri ace games story twists coming mile away revelation end chapter freaking obvious said valkyrie profile worth playing youve never experienced yes however having experienced honestly had waited price drop instead buying came despite still forward playing release original psp  hey ever played caesar yeah game basically knock off game better graphics quite frankly caesar more fun dont civcity has point build city nothing interesting ever happens progression game keeps fresh makers inter grated technologies wonders successful civilization game series inconsequential game people should stick good civilization series leave city games people know ive heard new installment caesar series caesar havent tried has better civcity rome game boring dont pay money  truth really hasnt been great mana game since secret mana every mana game since has been met astonishing mixed feelings children mana different why did buy knowing same reason many mana fans continue invest mana games theres always hope next installment same joy secret mana did unfortunately children mana does not doesnt rekindle magic secret mana gave shouldnt suggest falls short either world peril mana imbalance threatens send world dark ages hero heroine stop happening thus youll set save mana tree world itself children mana means has great storyline going least where falls short story more makes game play matter children mana dungeon crawler rpg falls dungeon crawling category enter dungeons theyre swarming monsters youll surrounded before know youll make through dungeon battling everything sight until reach boss take youre done rinse repeat process does times become annoying children mana offers variety interesting aspects game play make tidbit interest combat works actually pretty fun through dungeons killing things surprisingly addictive couple hours youve got three hit combos perform enemies knock enemies enemies theres quite bit inter sting things however sets apart lot dungeon crawlers cant ahead yourself too fast foremost cant equip everything find right off bat game actually restrict using overly powerful weapons until access certain dungeons until meet certain expectations keeps game being too simple youll access magic course each time dungeon take spirit magic spirit provides interesting play around dungeons dual wield weapons although not youd duel wield specifically mean equip weapons each time cant swinging both same time probably wouldve added more variety game play otherwise along lines giving character different assortment weapons gems improve stats combat abilities interesting not really deep youll mostly find purchase gems another interesting aspect game completely linear should decide dwell many side quests game has offer children mana not shy offering side missions theyre actually pretty worth problem game play however rinse repeat formula becomes very tiring very fast objective every dungeon find whats called gleam drop bring gleam annoying mostly each dungeon plays same fight through horde enemies retrieve gleam drop fight boss leave time becomes increasingly repetitive however children mana has great remedy too multi player four players play time game much more fun friends make through dungeons together sometimes blast moments slowdown playing multi player mode nothing too frustrated doesnt happen too often multi player alone adds lot variety complexity game play far graphics game doesnt too bad sprites like theyre ripped straight ouf sword mana game completely however mana games not been taking graphics limit theyve been unique art style children mana absolutely gorgeous artwork beautiful each environment given extremely good detail problem mentioned sprites not nearly detailed musically children mana sounds fantastic best sounding games date very few current games hold candle fantastic soundtrack bottom line simple children mana very fun game play very mediocre storyline theres enough variety interest game play keep going adventure storyline not great begin however keep mind children mana really dungeon crawl unrealistic expect rpg thats dungeon crawling fantastic storyline blow away whole youre looking game thats fun youll find children mana however youre looking game deep storyline endearing characters wont find children mana good beautiful artwork fantastic soundtrack theres lot variety game play multi player blasts tons side quests bad storyline isnt good game play has lot variety hard past fact repetitive  brought having played caesar loved wanted something bit more scope controlling dynamics city thought being civcity game offer extension wrong bad rip off caesar sure graphics more advanced zoom view playing same game less involvement control sit let happen game keep people happy build everything theyll stay caesar thats youre wanting looks like everything sets itself isnt feel like ive wasted money  played through halo really enjoyed single player campaign never played multi player game until bought halo lets halo multi player unparalleled multitude multi player games capture flag juggernaut team team etc dizzying variety terrains theres plenty keep halo fans busy blowing each addition alien elites playable character spice things wield weapons time each fist providing another combat option those gunslingers like battles john woo style unfortunately halo single player campaign not impressive whit alien covenants entire society based idea activating giant rings throughout universe known halos put journey spiritual evolution reality halo weapon designed destroy flood infestation aliens turn human alien alike vicious zombies keep flood infecting every living thing why utterly destroying every living thing universe course play alternates between master chief alien elite known arbiter gives player both sides story interesting point eventually plot converges enough characters should really end fighting each been something made play through both battles opposite sides creating enemy uses own moves instead midway through battle universe giant plant looks like audrey little shop horrors shows planet speaking jabba esque guttural tones rams plot down throats grabbing arbiter master chief shoving opposite plot lines arbiter ends working humans master chief ends doing alien dirty things really going halo hurtles towards final battle earth game ends should guessed something during interviews halo ceo bungee had ready finish war meant ready finish game thought were finishing halo youve probably noticed review second installment pirates caribbean really really really hate movies games fail provide whole story doesnt matter part three part series writers developers obligation provide full story create story beginning end though middle series evidenced towers halo improvement original loses points weak campaign forces play both sides throws talking plant clean mess  little brother lost original copy had buy new glad did love game much fun play like final fantasy game graphics were amazing game play  really looking forward game prepared overlook things every game has own personality right found instead game actually doesnt much didnt mind graphics not cutting edge sure not bad either little muddy change cartoony hard enjoy closeup views however many buildings lost roof zoom toggle feature camera angles were frustrating very difficult pick anything mouse accurately not much time scenery immigrants came came came whether were houses jobs available not long city happiness high enough meant everyone happy were not had houses jobs keep city happiness ensure somewhat stable economy forget planning forget balancing resources workshops markets wasnt clear balance case take trial error didnt time were building worships like mad trying guess many citizens employed each researching temporary bumps keep city being deserted droves best income boosts were not through sale goods trade through research maximizing tax base development currency hit those early reached certain population level made money rest time spent trying keep people leaving stability reaching level quickly became game keep control immigration set pace development decorative options more similar games really didnt care end city looked like cost time money too really not relevant issue unless people were unhappy stick few things quickly somewhere cant enjoy leisurely pace planning building finishing off nudge here watching run constantly involved process staying ahead curve dont worry maintenance such city fires engineers cities cannot not made self sufficient self sustaining inherent instability built game play five ten minutes away screen bring cities not screeching halt while enjoyed research options ability move homes thought great innovation not having ability control flow immigrants city pegging success city happiness makes game poor economic simulation game play ultimately very shallow unsatisfying  liked final fantasy youll like game youll play learn more story  thoroughly enjoyed playing final fantasy viii introductory movie hooked world story were very unique new battle system thought junction system fairly easy understand once got used loved more material system vii characters viii were very likeable interesting play game perspective student named squall happens favourite heroes final fantasy series cinematics game were very nicely produced captured best moments start finish had fun playing game highly recommend fans final fantasy series role playing games general  civ name has been tarnished analogously thing been learning sid meiers name product doesnt mean product good case civcity rome unfortunately doesnt modestly good comes dismally poor ive tried hard not let influence beliefs civilization general civ came starting believe firaxis games sid meier regret inform great civ titles were made long time ago offerings today simple pattern production rushed title came major bugs games add unnecessary features designed justify overall cost consumers often abused ridiculous expansion packs containing features should obviously been included original release take advantage love franchise pattern evident whole sid meier civ franchise degenerating almost seems especially release civcity rome once again expected simply drop cash new products based love old developers not living expectations producing great games stay away civcity rome besides obvious blunders associated bugs best patch cannot make graphics good narration sound effects better interface properly game dismal failure sorry report seems like firefly studios had idea got license firaxis cheesed watching maxis sims simcity franchises firaxis civilization franchise doing loyal fans like watching dad drunk  has pretty much been said lets again cause sure firaxis firefly plant positive reviews here game takes ages load voice acting silly british australian hermans hermits progression totally linear game fails become more complicated higher levels graphics date citizen fetching system completely random opaque sit watch awhile huts change size every thirty seconds importantly boo sid boo wouldve produced bad caesar ripoff called anything called civcity put tiny civilopedia havent got enough money civ series brilliant dont cash  off let part katamari damacy amazing game dont know story behind wasnt thought game designers thats why original game ideas came lady didnt like video games used ideas make world where youve played rpg youve played youve played shooter youve played etc katamari damacy huge breath fresh air glad popular music strangely catchy has great sense humor attention detail absolutely astounding ton must went game surprisingly very addictive fun fact unless youve actually played game wont understand fun addictive show many games like wouldnt like katamari damacy game actually play understand theres player mode where compete against friend roll around katamari ball stuff pick more more stuff automatically sticks katamari bigger katamari gets bigger stuff pick sounds stupid theres reason havent played yet trust rocks while katamari damacy looks like kids game not theres too much strategy too much nuance here young minds hand younger kids play chess maybe generally kids play stuff like halo requires little thought complaint level ive tried times beat level dont ever able game stops here has minute time limit closest ive got need not gaming genius anything least average gamer regularly play online against gamers very opinion really dropped ball level such strict requirement honest really surprised anybody has beaten level little time many more times should try disappointing maybe katamari more gaming friendly another thing view screen isnt quite big enough very easy lost little view cant change camera angle turn around probably better bigger camera view camera changes angles automatically controls turn around charge too difficult turn around press same time why not press button charge flip analog sticks down really fast too much trouble feature thats pretty useless anyway why run youll run something anyway game consists lot moving forth side dont need move forward fast not perfect game very impressive nonetheless wish play rest  played game friends town seriously had acquire satisfy craving not shooter game not rpg roll seriously surprisingly awesome actually big disappointment came days mildly committed playing done beat really not big gamer dont know much mileage really gonna sort limited player mode maybe sequel better hope  saw game number top games new wanted little bro like eww game horrible ask grandma buy fun love like games easy play  games faults been covered already ill roman era city builder looking save money wait caesar playing demo far superior game civcity every level seems game makers civcity were trying make failed miserably  unlike game youve ever played best possible easily bored grossed traditional racing shooting killing zombie games game refreshing change challenging enough keep entertained quite long time reviewers said ends too soon game lets repeat each level beat previous best score barely beat

should able allow enter numbers correlate numbers within system make mark intro content absurdly long skip huge waste time youve seen got game today ive spent hours trying figure blue such game recognize wish return opened software very frustrated entire experience  playing icewind dale reminds those novels written american authors late century though many novels were very written never seemed suck continue reading book icewind dale like looks nice supposedly improves game play gives player more character creation options dont really play why end seems icewind dale hurt extremely corny story bogged down numerous irrelevant puzzles involving running around constantly not fun predecessor bought game reason reason addicted baldurs gate needed expand party based rpg addiction another realm icewind dale seemed logical option wrong immediately confronted story corny almost embarrassing take part confronted game play caused run forth place another constantly confronted battles easy soon bored tried play again again plagued same problems installed bunch unofficial patches those did not solve problems terrible puzzles whatever else overload puzzles corniness diverge path baldurs gate where accomplish quests order wanted here had accomplish everything linear order never diverge path furthermore story seemed retread story original icewind dale fact design game seemed paralell completely final problem game concerns fact difficult play knowledge dungeons dragons rules not know rogues unfamiliar feats like game pose very high learning curve may not climb mostly familiar rules easy someone did not know easily make mistakes unfamiliar certain classes though rule book pretty exhaustive not good game baldurs gate icewind dale instead game  firstly been big fan aurora engine based rpg games loved bag plus iwd sequel found honest awful raised edition rule set never played exception nwn fact game based newer set rules didnt bother much computer game exact mechanics system dont understand thing did bother game fact big battle another commanders send endless suicide runs got point where simply leave game ruining hour while charters hack slash through tide randomly spawned critters got boring really fast not too mention difficult really sad part read general plot outline enthusiastic always wanted happen orc races banned together army attempted invade companions ones front lines against army point where pen paper rpgs tell fellow hiring shove  bought game xmas gift old boys play game non stop basically until theyre completely worn game perfect kids exercise long winter months kids game must  game looked crazy couldnt resist mean disney squaresoft trying merge final fantasy load disney cartoons must seemed like cool idea japan since love cartoons much usa insane top voice talents mandy moore lance bass production values knew had ridiculous games history hardcore fans were bothered looked like kids game arent games supposed aimed children teens anyway ultimately disappointed kingdom hearts world characters kingdom hearts not really final fantasy disney crossover place kids control little melodrama like idea disney meets final fantasy takes seat once past hype kingdom hearts boring frustrating nagging issue tiny areas game planet alice wonderland consists four small rooms course spend great deal time fighting off monsters combat blend chaotic button mashing watching party members act like total fools until die worst respawning monsters cant take step without having fight fight hoards shadow munchkins had defeated youll spend majority money healing items bosses nightmare since hard survive take forever kill minutes normal since combat simple really makes drawn battles beyond boring beating bosses done game know kingdom hearts mushashi samurai legend final fantasy same combat woes wish squaresoft learn respawning enemies bosses million hit points thing past  before anything played game beaten week provided blockbuster grudgingly playing though unbaiased opinion game completely stupid sequel retarded again opinion  little fellas inside computer run around shouting doodler door doodler door thinking theyre good thinking theyre plotting against cant turn off evil befall caution beware  really not tell anything still not received game despite having paid month half ago  please promise never play not worth time paid money try find person gave money kick shin hard throw copy game dumpster seriously though game absolutely terrible graphics bad psx combat quickly becomes boring hell story line confused fact second dimension pointless reason being something characters were exactly same statwise were poorly designed annoying thing world bar nothing having equip characters spells whenever switch characters like spell slots god dont need those crumbums square couldnt pull another hit oversized victorian tophats wanted too should really stick straight video final fantasy anime movies lest risk making something like again  not half baked product placement tool biowares decision make game pre date movies great gave considerable creative freedom within confines star wars brand biggest reason why kotor won game awards yes not swing double bladed light saber around force powers story strong plot crucial every rpg kotor doesnt disappoint plot course includes biggest twists video game history fans know talking dont buy game games principal characters while somewhat stereotypical bastila condescending socialite snob carth tough loner troubled past etc very together good chemistry including created character example play female character soon becomes obvious carth develops feelings feels slightly guilty lost wife not too long ago youll find yourself acting mediator allies dont along each canderous carth fought opposite sides mandalorian wars took place five years before aside character development game feels very rich star wars ness example names bioware came planets people feel sound like george lucas himself approved despite said earlier review cutting down enemies light saber looking good doing has got joys kotor admit got dantooine verge becoming jedi trembling excitement going build own light saber wondered color going choose having said things keep game getting stars felt game bit linear being able choose planets order gives illusion open ended game play hoping storyline different depending whether decide evil good everything plays same save few minor events certain conversations doorway bug causes sometimes stuck moving through doorway narrow corridors happens wiggle thumb stick free yourself ive never had real problems bug distracting found moving around menu screens problematic press start main menu pull trigger buttons move between screens often pull trigger multiple times before game responds sure many people agree games graphics not xbox standards capable doing better dont usually gripe graphics textures background buildings taris downright laughable overall bioware serious kudos taking daunting task like creating new star wars game sing eternal praises actually making fun not stretch bought xbox play kotor few titles thats another story glad made investment hey stop reading play  game played gamecube spongebob battle bikini bottom absolutely loved daughter plays over thinking shrek similar rented very hard control stick kept zooming wouldnt rotate camera except certain times char actors were very distant used stick zoom still wasnt close enough same feeling needing put eyeglasses something more clearly another aspect didnt like four char actors always together lose track main character maybe were spoiled stick spongebob allowed rotate every direction around graphics were good facial expressions surprising reviews good impression completely opposite  loved incredibles excited play game ive been playing video games last couple years off really beginner perhaps explains enormous difficulty ive had game boyfriend long time video game player able things tries labored hours using cheat codes did not really help much surprised read review said game too easy almost cried lol seriously unless good gamer youre probably going more frustrated challenged game guess ill stick action rpgs  pros exciting absorbing story line great gaming experience cons minor bugs single player game cannot replay more few times  point thankfully wasnt directed good ole george setting game years before star wars new hope few years devastating mandolorian wars truly fun role playing game rpg including interesting characters everyone unique histories including yours almost flawless turn based combat system sinister universe dominating villian etc point graphics arent greatest still nothing scoff bugs dialogue movies nothing serious music produced gaming world famous jeremy soule amazing completely allows player become immersed game play basically every action mostly dialogue has good light side neutral bad dark side outcome reason dark side going things more full filling many movie seen force powers lightning force choke powers known knights old republic kotor included keeping toes while playing spoiler alert incredibly small universe characters meet become apart party past self parts journey once beginning once more fourth player gets choose class character time around kind grunt old republics second kind super powerful kick bite head off jedi best xbox games ever period better rpgs well  impossible product key gave didnt might make frisbee dvd jerri  put together game

classic madden game very fun very addictive very challenging franchise mode best feature basically pick team decide much pay players order keep under salary cap players dump rehire pretty much everything else takes run team lot things online mode where play players country play modes feature keep entertained clear until next madden game comes problem online players know cheat sports strongly denies possible cheat online many good players mad someone talks cheaters online good players people blame others cheating sore losers true lot time however personally seeing things computer nerd brother hack anything possible website ton people lot smarter figure cheat anything finally reason made drop rating star overall star overall infamously not popular superstar mode super star mode sucks retry forever pedigree parents top cant fully player high rating categories make good player speed agility strewth etc improve players stats never where eventually finally agent gets access performance institute doesnt much good using performance institute increases stats temporarily good news ive heard through grapevine madden feature greatly improved youll able run yard dash equally

adapts improves flaws last years game much like football coaches teams real life cool thing actually take advice fan base unlike game companies madden comes across problem adapt fix problem game probably deserved star overall rating instead star overall rating video game company adds new feature game better cool really pisses off through trouble add new feature really excited new feature ends being stupid  very interesting game lots places explore game play pretty smooth sometimes rapid fire button help lot game very bookish cut scenes movie fairly complicated times strange moves master like flying shoes umbrellas fun game good graphics  many rpgs world make theyre same open container take weapons health kits dead body spell kotor different sadly combat imho really boring enemy screen freezes decide ahead time moves make doesnt kill enemy character automatically does standard attacks unless pause game set next moves umm many times has been done before wanted bought final fantasy whatever number theyre enjoyment taken using things like blaster rifles light sabers same idea using shovel something nethack good thing games like ever quest world warcraft took stale old rpg formula did something new  hours play far gotten lot more enjoyment game did reading three books series themselves probably took less hours read where shall begin describing really fun game characters themselves realistically animated sunny animations especially amusing bites things squeals does little dances etc ive smiled laughed lot characters were represented voices very good including major actors appearing upcoming film although not pervasive during normal game play scenario great fun far more involving books far playing piano break apart open real riot settings creepy little roaches crawling rats spiders such game reaches level art did soundtrack music awesome wondrous dingy mansion count olaf episodes light relief fill player sense peace wonder library scene uncle montys house garden garden butterflies flapping grass blowing wondrous music playing big tree adventure klaus flying greenery rivers etc finally made video game reaching level artistic accomplishment like good painting lost enjoy details sensory input wow concerned might through game too quickly hours though being midway through know getting worth surely play through whole thing more once watches favourite video takes hike along favourite forest path calculate per hour game giving far better return seeing film theater comes although plan too thats not counting games resale value afterward addition special game features tie film players eventually awarded film photos information film extra note game players dont players great deal benefit bradyguide game game guide poorly mapped far comprehensive while instruction manual comes game itself gives enough instruction detail allow players start proceed save yourself avoiding bradyguide map make yourself while playing likely far more useful halfway through game far got useful tips guidebook figured those clues own anyway  bought dino crisis games playstation were fantastic survival horror fun very taken hype around game billed

crudhole good reviews either retarded never played decent game  huge spyro fan been playing since great second better third forth happened purchasing mine amazon cheaply something like regret doing waste money seen whole game bit repetative frustrating never seem anywhere voices changed series gamer enjoyed origional spyro games dont buy dont disappointed however under probably very much enjoy

inconvenience loading play game gets annoying finish game save start loading time alone kill feeling wanting play game play itself bone crushing hits please outside occasional dirty hit far easier computer employ vice verse hits like early developments madden plays fairly easy until carter seems everytime computer magically score points matter defensive strategies employ whole steriods issue laughable player juice misses plays conventionally treat misses gator either youll never miss game horrible graphics load times save money buy game least remotely capture interest  game really big disappointment had try game hype reviews here having played nintendo game titled mario kart felt like not much improvement fact feel mario kart better game improvement graphics still why characters

example better combat racing game burnout games series good combat racing game feels like feel mario kart double dash dumbed down version mario kart much wanted great game longer has hopping ability previous game wasnt very good double dash probably better very young gamers probably more forgiving shortcomings  game came highly recommended people generally similar taste games still trying figure why theres question game graphics impressive story line interesting however game play nearly non exist ant happen participate action controls either badly executed unnecessarily complicated sphere grid blitz ball story often poorly told stilted voices hilariously bad character animation had compare game squaresofts efforts similar mix between final fantasy chrono cross while those games were generally frowned upon rpg enthusiasts final fantsy has recieved almost universal praise short not much disappointed game baffled warm reception  love game havent played ddr games before not sure compares others great songs like lot dont theyre challenge fun like dance master mode unlock songs doing havent made far play same levels over again theyre fun game great people ages includes music young old  workout home fun already recommend video game  ive been gta fan few years san andreas has got best time swim fell water accidental discovered new action character graphics more real making

game very fun doesnt last very long like books should rent probably wont buy though rented yesterday beat today very fun not long  quite unsure whether buy film not didnt going type film bought game anyway although hadnt yet seen film anyway glad did took days complete although isnt long long very good beginning end basically going round different rooms house doing different things may seem boring actually really fun activities etc great definitely good game like more adventurous games arent too hard like too hard games arent really type cant wait film recently bought  bought game whim having really liked need speed hot pursuit game needs help frame rate lower should slow down game before need speed underground looked times better car models wanted touch nicer looking far better selection underground thats plus game has dont race much fly around city barely controlled frenzy trying stay ahead computer cars winning more luck skill hits least obstacles wins hardly enjoyable race too stressed playing game put away while definitely rent before buying game  started caesar came played hours hours loved caesar came bought too loved more spent more time playing both caesar

carnage simply unavoidable firm believer save game option should removed many not person games raises intensity level dramatically story itself fairly average dialogue more really places far cry below likes half life basically following instructions entire game used violent killing machine real choices reason didnt care absorbed surroundings simply surviving didnt lower enjoyment enemies very good flanking whenever possible generally actually trying avoid being shot rather running straight plenty occasions though where enemy stand distance while shoot plain sight generally good weapons fantastic being both highly effective satisfying sniper rifle always personal favourite game makes awesome massive maps open ground while initially prepared standard serious sam type game far cry turned much more fantastic graphics inspired level design forced variations play fiercely intense gunfights make game absolute winner add value money since long missions through save option those take

defender turns nitrous oxide installed uniform cover half field seconds deflect pass throw high pass not worry lineman has installed jet packs allows jump feet air deflect pick off pass cpu wants lose lose matter going pass lineman feet away press passing button stand take sack game total off passes heavy pressure becuase game forces tackle animation playing defence better off putting down controller clipping nails flossing teeth while cpu pulls miracle plays every single down remember said receivers purposely drop wide open passes not cpu receivers cpu receivers regardless rating catch passes double triple coverage every time dont catch ball gets tipped over again until catch stopped down conversion again flagged pass interference face mask penatly remember being forced tackle animation not cpu cpu yard spirals while hes being hit inconsistency ask let explain game totally next game cant complete pass ill tell why cpu wants lose drop every pass fumble every run called every penalty book playing game managed run punt before offense touched field sudden cpu turned god mode every thing went right cpu lobs runs calls did not complete single pass entire half not cpu playing good defence receivers dropped every ball thrown wide open not ended completing pass entire game point knew had chance winning started punting ball down avoid more frustration called impact got yards rushes called impact gave passes below average receiver point playing not given chance win yes win games inconsistent cpu wants lose lose nothing why bought license putting crap like were sure lose

customization remember fire weapon time cycle between lazers cannons rockets bored minutes again people never played series may like game better  opening cutscene introduces blinx cat supporting cast particulars upcoming adventures found myself trying wrap brain around basic premise story idea secret off world clan humanoid cat creatures armed souped vacuum cleaners responsible development dispersal time itself every known plane existence map seems time compressed tightly enough transported said cats takes form five different brightly colored shapes crystals left open too long without being properly introduced flow things turn monsters game certainly doesnt stop point like theres fairly thick line drawn between cartoony fantasy super detailed realism generally lot physics environmental details taken granted realistic game theyre almost exclusively set photorealistic lifelike location cartoons hand generally dont worry themselves particulars primarily concerned delivering good time much fun wile coyote cartoons every time lead character suffered grisly fate strictly obeyed laws gravity aerodynamics blinx tries straddle thick line delivering story thats overly detail centric environment thats right kids show result tale comes off left field almost completely abstract focuses things better left viewers imagination ignores importance good underlying story along beneath needless discussions why monsters world time compression works cats actually responsible hold dear actual plot almost laughably straightforward generic theres princess evil pigs kidnapped you rescue save world thats side stories reasoning subplots straightforward rush point point here thought phrase save princess universally recognized ages old cliche dont sound like railing game got few more nitpicky details peers reuses old phrase platformer handbook sole driving factor completely lacking character development general storytelling ongoing inspiration none characters blinx really establish themselves individuals including lead character himself dont hate pig spaceship hes trying destroy world hate every time shows tries steal money honestly forgot princess end game level three shes never mentioned between games start finish mean very super mario brothers least reminded princess another castle end every boss fight dont honestly game really designed enjoyable much geared overly challenging level half set standard know format simplest enemies routine stage layouts plenty opportunities mess around tools shortly thereafter youre thrown wolves part level designs very short more emphasis cheap hits complexity true challenge noticed lot overlap stage layouts whether retracing steps time time again walking along catwalk har har above beginning stage invariably plummeting start point youll almost always know needs done actually accomplishing act real trick cant overemphasize unbearably cheap game really theres bottomless pit nearby chances very good blinx find force himself regardless youre hitting control pad theres enemy feet front you hit attack button hell aim random switch side room rather imminent threat thats not entirety time sweeper totally without merit does bring few fresh ideas table part those insights hampered surroundings ability control time instance time really fresh interesting new play mechanic still stands today despite limited field imitators since emerged rewind few seconds catch enemy unaware rebuild crumbling bridge pause action take advantage frozen time knock level slow motion etc while blinx moving around real time great idea implementation painfully short underutilized why cant controls same time why dont more aspects stage encourage player experiment solve problems powers why doesnt ridiculous ten minute stage time limit pause speed rewind time powers why duration brief why cant hold more dozen uses time mean couldve really been fantastic experience time control aspect had been beefed little further treated more auxiliary function otherwise run mill platformer controls too undeveloped undertested nightmare blinx himself often sluggish respond especially implementing time controls has difficulty making precise turn whether midair solid ground stops briefly celebrate gaining item leaves open constant enemy attacks routinely moves direction certain death though pulled magnetic field whether youve instructed not hell occasionally refuse perform double jump particularly attempting difficult precise leap across gaping chasm controls make blinx mind squashingly aggravating glance youd imagine theyd fairly difficult screw youve got jump button suction fire button time control button analog stick control movement plus had already been long established line three dimensional platformers market years before titles release paving ideal control experience super mario had issues sure nothing like trailblazer entire genres jump world like had map leading right treasure decided forge own path anyway cant impressed graphics showcased throughout time sweeper either exception lead character himsef incredibly cheesy preschoolish character designs feel unfinished hurried less purposeful youd imagine especially contrast blinx himself particularly insulting large population simple blobs roam around levels trying vain bump cause fatal injury heres finely detailed main character such close attention paid wardrobe gloss shoes obviously debated time time again hes pitted against set monsters couldve sprung life directly pages four olds sketchbook despite featuring spoken dialog track theres english voice acting couldnt pinpoint language wife seems either french close variation certainly didnt sound japanese while does add touch personality title not every chance hear cat shouting something language love seemed really odd place coming television everyones vocal personalities black white too feel like great chance establish much needed individuality amongst cast lost once again here bad guys same deep gravelly transparently evil tone while good guys bright cheery squeaky high pitched like monkeys super monkey ball like parody games had before wont developers enough credit assume were doing purpose overall blinx really few promising concepts thrown together package strapped shell far below average third person platformer unleashed upon unsuspecting public time release still need lot polishing serious scrutiny behind closed doors evaluation far concepts half hearted character designs conceivably stretched without losing quality top really dont know audience were targeting game ridiculously difficult betrays childlike demeanor surrounds leads believe meant serious gamers bright kid friendly annoyingly cutesy cant imagine anyone demographic rushing stores release number spontaneous controller hurls shot through roof during time blinx reaching near marvel capcom levels unashamed excruciatingly cheap hits especially later levels idea acquired willpower finish level eight game adequately lengthy offers replay value hidden cat medals each stage eventually unlocking production sketches promotional materials like once start hunting floating cat heads those super tough later levels though youll remember why were happy finished place unless feel like pulling hair clumps shaved head experience part

uncomfortable begin hurt half hours wearing halo headset actually forgot wearing light released new version headset comes communicator difference price greatly recommend headset anyone plays xbox live

game however incredibly disappointing driving controls especially compared driving controls godfather awful having much trouble driving kept looking through handbook doing something wrong saw using controller supposed missions involve driving under specific time limit awful controls gave early too frustrating musical play list control fun liked more free roaming like godfather looking forward hearing everyones voices were opening credits dale earnhardt since almost totally given guess wont hear voice acting talent does anyone know plan release xbox maybe control issues worked before game had much potential right not living  love game ive been playing every since came not those boring whilepros good graphics good game play lots mechs live support content download lot people xbox live lots missionscons bit repetetiv  every has game adapted classic movie based classic movie russia love actually not bad game recentlty landing hands copy simply couldnt resist picking scarface world yours loved movie scar face gonna love turns didnt controls really joke instead normal fps rpg etcetera really bland controls cant tell dialouge corny everything else joke die hard fans guess  game has good concept nice graphics definitely funny moments game play total bore main game play styles investigation trial investigation worst involves nothing more checking everything room talking everyone ton pointless reading much like old point click adventure court sections little better not much once again very linear dont brain much try options once again huge amount reading too much

received fine never received controller finally got notification shipping delay several weeks later yet controller still listed ships within hours amazon delays kept coming eventually turned cancelled order amazon star service delay lack full explanation knows controller been wonderful  playstation controller nice however nintendo user remember controller snazzy maybe more xbox controller like brick compared both delivered vibrating dual shock controller standard unit controller feels great thumb pads thumb sticks allowing sorts movement suddenly four years released games like metal gear solid iii snake eater god war improve thumb pad function new mini games feature controller has been given new life big negative problem sony controllers extremely poor quality controller design dual shock shocked suddenly break drop floor easily damage wing buttons dont drop wing buttons usually break less enjoy gaming next shock going through many controllers design flaw adding cost each controller easily bought myself another more cord has uncanny ability wrap around itself kink never seen managed remain straight button breaks tends release little pieces controller dont need button game controller feels like has sand rolling around inside handheld conditioning controller far robust used very similar logitech cordless rumblepad same design controller proper robust model comparing side side makes controller like developed ussr early something fact sony done absolutely nothing improve quality own generic controller probably reason why made much money unit too expensive controller more robust hope sony right next time make controllers more robust please controller always far quality device since inception item let down badly  very scary literely shaking while playing game couldnt stop playing  remember doom came lot hype internet people were claiming blow away release half life ids new engine etc etc etc unfortunately doom rather standard shoot fun little while lacks originality inventiveness games like half life amazing half life kept engaged terrain changes characters change doom basically lot walking around through dimly lit corridors monsters jump kill fun while becomes tiring much like haunted house ride become tiring five hours straight furthermore graphics engine really isnt everyone made bought new runs game very maximum settings game play isnt choppy anything full potential graphics theyre shadowing brilliant textures average characters cut scenes downright laughable commanders early looks like character avp game came game play much better characters more realistic wonder rush cut scenes theyd spend more attention detail overall admit while found fun times gets tedious while mean gimmick flashlight annoying someone else pointed beginning okay should planted upgrade early game such helmet flashlight attached top nightvision goggles last minute before recharged dropping flashlight picking weapon while youre being shot enemies annoying another reviewer pointed pda gimmick gets old fast overall has moments absolute brilliance felt like much more been done should abandoned concept being alone dark throughout entire game done bit more loved explored martian planet more levels dont exactly same repetitive nature game ultimately sinks good half life far better graphics engine stunning years later  few outfits new furniture not lot free stuff download sims stuff pack not very worth maxi milking franchise every penny  brilliant remake original classic although avid fan doom strongly urge not juxtapose sit pick apart differences between youll never enjoy doom why game worth buy many reasons superb graphics youll notice environment rich detailed dont worry whether not computer handle easily build easily capable running game full settings less youre comp old cant run like may been due upgrade anyways weapons great very realistic like real world arsenal must reloaded many rounds fired handy pair digits help monitor clip total ammo weapon though plan ahead keep guns fully loaded endless series hallways people complaining makes absolutely sense stadium set mars research base game offers plenty larger rooms adequately utilize heavier weapons such rocket launcher without blowing own face off ambient sounds game more enough keep edge seat dead bodies randomly levitate fly across room grates knocked around unseen forces betrugers haunting laugh often accompany many ghostly actions more enemies fierce enemies bad fearful easy kill downright lethal may not very many good looks really shouldnt trying admire pixels something thats trying kill take screenshot later take monsters like experiment arsenal learn best weapon job conserving ammo wont problem big issue people seem lighting yes century youd expect marines lights mounted weapons software isnt stupid flashlight guns made game lot easier lot less fun switching light gun game forces choose between being able enemy being able attack enemy remember game horror genre horror thrives asking questions like where where gonna pop next rent horror movie youll mean dark doom meant like buy game borrow buddy turns lights off turn volume like horror pull right  noticed were not many new items game found advertising game deceiving expansion not worth money  ive been through doom three times time didnt cheat wont great game stick few short comings game started off perfect little bit realism goes long later degraded world comic bookish nightmareism skeletons missile launchers shoulders bugger man rocket launcher pace right hand aaah isnt hard figure why did were trying spice bit keep interesting understand dont agree mass attacks monsters hard won ammunition instead transport marine once more search find same things again games monster nazi helmet whip more comic book filler three game has cheat every room searched gets little irritating know monster side darkened doorway throw dozen gernades monster isnt hurt take step forward monster jumps blast course monster appeared nowhere behind attacks answer course walk backward trip statment program shoot monster behind turn around shoot front second attempt through door tired computer gamecheating makes cheat beat game dont mind dark areas whole base went expect lights not always four ive heard those knights destroyed big green glowing plasma gun cannon did thirty eight hand grenades game been better three had been turn loose roam hallways looking humans munch randomly five basically never enough fighting room understandable station another world pressurized atmosphere rooms small exploding barrels pressurized enviroment hoot yuck yes said yuck instead number belted ammunition machineguns usually came round belts not sixty mini guns used chained belts know repair plasma guns munitions travel far too slow shotgun needs longer barrel still has choke keep pellets spread too wide becoming useless ten feet handgrenades cant thrown properly light machineguns firing rate half should goodiness sake duck tape flashlight tape weapon list little things game easily worth money remember mostly suggestions future program  downloading objects fan sites

awesome playing football games since mid sick paying same game every games owns rights college nfl teams wont football games game companies noteably sega revolutionized football simulation games late ncaa football basically same ncaa football each adds little tweak mix overall same same feel same moves same everything theyve changed kick ball added more defensive audibles thats few minor adjustments none worth noting imo fact audibles added exact same audibles used segas espn football call audibles individual defensive players thieves everything else exact same disappointing thing graphically speaking crowd still looks like flat rows objects moving unison like did games made years ago big change improved momentum meter thought ridiculous last wait til play ncaa momentum meter has such strong influence game make offensive mistake beginning game youre doomed thats cant win example played fsu twice time made half errors pounded hurricanes played same exact settings same stadium again purposely fumbled opening kickoff giving hurricanes ball line lost game fumble mistake game nessler herbstriet corso still making same exact game comments were saying gimme break still atrocious defensively computer controlled team hapless blitz every down fact ive lined numerous times long receivers defence continually loads men box dont put enough dbs stop basically game long bombs choose team good receivers easily throw yards game continually going deep safeties always blitz safeties drop coverage does computer couteract deep balls easy momentum meter swings against favor receivers drop every ball throw hit chest ball finally decide run ball running fumbles ball immediately played game between usc cal kept switching play team didnt momentum ended turning ball every possession may reading saying hey guy has played game lot figure not really exactly ive played game same glitches ive encountered too has really dropped ball again paying updated rosters typical fashion dont names players different skill levels games suck soccer games horrible basketball games too slow awkward dont update football games guarantee madden same madden watch has gone xbox editions ncaa ans madden sure those versions stunning rest paying same price last years game  ive been playing ncaa few weeks here thoughts game simply does good job capturing feeling sport game anyone has been big time sec game understands stadium does shake did not play career mode simply prefer control whole program gameplay very strong anyone has played ncaa madden past notice tightening controls personally not like person camera special teams plays makes frustratingly difficult return kicks likewise without auto slo motion key plays absolutely destroys flow play highlight catch hit during play thats replay system annoyingly apt hit unsportsmanlike conduct penalties not tds simple catches defensive plays more control recruiting season recruiting including mulitple pitches campus visits versions new set unlockables changing logo sponsor does not new unlockable make  game looks plays like missions locations varied colorful villians range fat guy dynamite strapped person corrupt law officials usual rockstar keeps game play challenging not overly frustrating lots unlockables offer high replay unique best looking games system period still throw every months another thru story straightforward engaging lots really interesting concepts machinegun coffin crazy midgets whole dead eye thing controls very another great game outstanding company hopefully sequel works  game good cheap buy didnt before cant afford gun buy game cause copied  typical xbox game using checkpoints instead creativity make challenging nothing more mind numbing doing same thing over again keep getting killed right before next checkpoint granted hours hours playing time something havent already done times before highly recommend game people intellect enjoy working production lines where same thing repeatedly brain actually requires kind stimulation find more creative game addition actions tend bit uncooperative times such attempting knock someone instead stand waiting shot apparently arent facing perfect position attempting smash brains stand like manakin hoping guy inches front doesnt notice another option try shoot unless head shot expect fire gobs rounds take since seem armed short pistol  nothing more really needs said running ghz ati radeon series pci express video card ram game still hangs lags locks computer tried uninstallingandreinstalling same effect not buy gam  western fanatic love wild west try eyes hands anything western wild west tech desperados wild wild west gbatu far game awesome cant wait new western game gun coming nov thing game needs though good bad ugly theme make game perfect untill dicide add loopin song player volume down almost enough here saying  overall impression game made rush assuming good alignment win simply building expensive buildings edge influence zone burning enemys platoons sent very unintelligent since winning requires strategy game challenging basically same levels races against fights pretty much same except skins buildings aspect defeating takes hours game play unlike previous version custom campaigns nor multi player features cinematics creature apart looks like very primitive version age empires  good solid game love very hard throught game lnow company know has done good old western game like rockstar truely best company gaming ever world still more games coming like manhunt warriors bully world famous gta grand theft auto series graphics sound gameplay overall ever doesnt best western game ever  splinter cell series three amazing games date available xbox game cube game boy advance set play sam fisher elite

caught enemy country deny existence connection like sliver glass small sharp nearly invisible splinter cell splinter cell highly renowned being ground breaking game introduced world true stealth gaming light shadows key elements game play vital role success unlike action games where quickly run around guns blazing splinter cell must tactical approaches slip enemies were never creeping around shadows best approach however sometimes seen choice eliminate witnesses doing should elect hide bodies shadows not alert anyone presence causing panic easily create real mess sound alarms quickly end mission bad play light dark very executed amplifies immersive qualities game years initial release splinter cell still worth picking playing fact originally purchased splinter cell game cube take advantage exclusive connectivity features enable player sticky cams tactical map displayed gba very neat playing following splinter cell games pandora tomorrow chaos theory xbox did decide buy xbox version original splinter cell played through missions again time including exclusive downloadable maps xbox live found more enjoyable fist time around splinter cell truly classic timeless game should every gamers collection  game itself very interesting storyline engaging controls unique rpg quite switch mario major problem game interactivity not enough specifically far too many cutscenes not skippable many cutscenes lead directly boss battle frustrating instance before final boss battle takes minutes real fight prior save point isnt problem time through sequence lose times becomes hassle makes game not really worth playing end major problem game designers found arounds nintendo revealed lack rpg experience element interesting game make sure win friend sibling enemy skip through dialog sequences tired them  game not everyone able read play last time checked not everyone read bought old son has autisum master every game cant read game not much fun ended playing more did didnt enjoy  games such grand theft auto san andreas driv true crime etc competition fierce game like wont cut max talks sounds like mumbling second graphics suck third game sucks general glad got used bet returned too dumb previous owner saw games must mean sucks read rockstar game rights remedy sales sequel max payne were low clue made greatest hit play gta true crime instea  had high hopes game disapointed controls horrible definitely voice acting throughout bad story line basically typical really didnt hold interest long did beat game spent came figured least gave game friend mine beat had same opinion did worth renting definitely not worth buying hopefully those decide buy rent game devote good bit time trying learn controls  game waste time everything crap game gave huge headache god advil said took long time make game not worth nothing cameras very bad makes dizzy play part game were follow maze pich dark lines maze fall off almost every time plus baby crying too does help like said waste time plus max payne looks fuuny game take good face looks like resident evil walking dead said took long time make game game should never been release  game really bad mean everything took long make waste off time money gave star guns best thing crap gam  totally awesome favourite game ever sound revolutionary graphics top notch real youll freak although version has four extra levels thirty minutes impressive new dialoge cinematics buy version were must own every gamer change life  played game shocked good stealth game actually realistic ways hide shadows enviroment take enemies really fun suspense main things happens game guns during whole game pistol rifle has attachments good stuff need take whole building full enemies crouch move slowly enemy doesnt very realistic game happy series games got released highly recommend game great storyline last level hecka hard  driving physics unrealistic obtaining licenses extremely difficult made worse poor car physics heavy car easily bounces off light cars while light cars easily derail heavy car turning steering wheel slightly produces heavy tire squeal thats sports tires long gone espn like replays reason cars thinner before analog tachometer has been reduced bar across screen mechanics headache prone made worse poor physics cars easily inadequate music ever game makes start used model certain makes nothing new however takes long time earn money better car horsepower upgrades make huge differences track game has mostly newer models almost none few years ago unlike good thing game dont drive time spec driving mode win races leave few minutes return victory screen help skipping painful early parts game powertrain still not modifiable compression bore stroke camshaft timing overlap valve size engine characteristics still not available poor driving physics engine modification not helped game loading times very long annoying loading indicator ever constant auto saving feature quick become annoying excessive amount confirmation screens game yet another disappointment much like makers game made quite clear know real cars drive like drive real gran tourismo series unlikely return used not racing game fan good enough buy good car make independent physics need play gran tourismo  theres alot rpgs ppl stumble find research those finding found myself happy camper got got going play very long time play short amount time positive dungeon crawl types love favourite part particular game not having key chart sitting front times glance remind key does hate games many controls cant play memorizing

looking easter eggs love playing multi player someone did bash multi player tons rooms kick cussing killing teammates ive had game years never tired playing online actually kind addicting  love game great story line make sure computer handle  action action satisfaction totally awesome entirtaining videogame rock world cool new characters weapons tactics awsomeness  rented game old loves movie tried play like tried play itandgot dancing part couldnt past tried days rental time returned havent rented since game too hard beat old got bored real fast not recommend game anyone dont waste money buying unless expert video games thankful rented instead buying  rented game returned next between friend not past dancing scene tried like hour couldnt past dont waste time patience annoying game  decided buy star wars republic commando xbox son wont let play version find seems like plays easier xbox game far best ive ever played awesome find very exiting actually feels like being part combat squad everyone team knows pro active rather reactive havent seen game yet where squad members react direct indirect fire commandos dont move team theyll job redirect orders follow orders letter being able inject bacta makes game whole lot better finding med kit hand while youre injured being rescued crew definitely gives feeling team regret small game short least felt like has three major campains game much fun seemed like time flew hope lucasarts decides make republic commando maybe based missions omega squad heres hoping definintely recommend game squad based combat star wars fans alike youll kick definintely fan delta squad republic commandos  star wars battlefront star wars knights old republic game getting lego star wars mail really like star wars battlefront star wars knights old republic game hard place much like got game days ago like played until like woke next beat maybe took half beat really mad beat having fun suddenly ended really stupid ending too good really good control squad variety different orders such telling squad mate set sniping position spot telling slicer slice open door good dont everything yourself dont rely squad covering fire takes whole minute slice computer data base weapons pretty sweet ones never really seen before except maybe thermal detonators wookie bowcaster become incapacitated tell squad revive dont feel like fighting tell maintain current orders revive fighting done heal yourself bacta station better running health container good squad actually knows fight bad game lot shorter expected different planets ships different enemies battle droids super battle droids trandoshans geonosians magna guards enemies act same every battle super battle droids really annoying fight really tough beat blaster rife unless youre noob play easy telling squad things gets repetative while ending sucks once beat play game harder setting not really fun play friends multiplayers isnt fun either put shelf while until youre bored feel like playing again really fun game until beat suggest pace yourself  pointless quests real conclusions ctd every minutes lengthy dialoge real human attachment very unpolished product patch favourite aspect game story not buy game  such great visuals love star wars rpg shooters cant believe point click game hoping kotor implimented normal battle engagement theres nothing worse toggling thru menus etc during intense battle actually having turn around click target engage someone else kill days boulders gate point click should guess theres crowd type game play still good game dissapointed  game pretty cool man squad made leader orange scorch demoshing guy yellow fixer guy hacks stuff green sev sniper red game basicly battle geonsis wht happens eposode amazingly almost like halo parts has more blood like stab alien knife blood shoots visor yes game has more robots anyhow game becoming dated here youll love  game very good jsut sucks cant quit before know don  lucas should ashamed stamp name turkey not play xbox experience random sound shreiks resolution issues too lonng load times overall really buggy perplexing product why very good  throughly enjoyed game voice acting may not greatest game play really done atmospheres fantastic controls take getting used too not everyone problem been better control surprisenly very major problem game progresses gives less times save through almost entire level though short complete without saving once stupid die end entire level again dumbest thing ever video game feel unfair game makers make fairly difficult level make over slip die toward end stupid stupid stupid levels bit difficult youre not quick trigger much gripe camera angles theyre useful stopping max end hall swing camera around enemy around corner waiting steps right inside next room etc gives heads makes easier stay alive however still really liked didnt enjoy much should end series should should much better looking forward  commercials max payne third person shooter twist twist being able kill mobsters junkies mercenaries slow motion truly gets hooked being able leap backward slow motion whilst rapidly firing dual handguns put kibosh those trying same aside slow max payne essentially third person shooter whereupon take control title undercover cop turned anti hero max payne story unfolds dramatically delve game jist maxs wife baby were brutally murdered junkies hes hunt revenge plot widens thickens nearly bursts progress through game never tell truly maxs side until moment credits roll end bottom line game very much based slow motion bullet time gunfights nearly impossible without ability slow down aim fire apt precision brings issue controls cons game controls many times fallen off balconies ledges due analog stick making max move right heavy load times add agony especially dozen tries still cannot overcome obstacles game definitely run sliding scale chapters start cake walk progress veritable teeth grinder point fed enraged game had outside take walk however take time relax focus patient should little problem game guns lots more ammo handle oftentimes youll find gun really like stick process having leave ammo behind corpses enemies being said guns dont hold much ammo especially given fact huge surplus ammunition abounds max chews painkillers like chocolate chips order heal himself proof hes not guy messed personally very much hooked cutscenes treated comic book style dialogue inner soliloquies lifted dashiell hammett novel however simply put either love detest game reeled very glad ive beaten seen end however cannot enough max payne additional difficulty settings unlocked beating along third harder setting unlocked those game parts extremely easy parts extremely challenging wouldnt recommend picking game unless youre ready oftentimes graphic violence innuendo potty mouthery wouldnt recommend picking game youre not ready put verge ripping hair frustration however conquerable youll very much pleased once overcome challenges  bought game thought great game wrong dont lightsabre until far game advertisments shows lightsabre game extremely buggy has poor graphics huge starwars fan not reccomend game anyone matter big starwars fan dont buy game  very flashy very fun car chase shooting game different vehicles guns like game play makes good story line theres hardly dialogue cut scenes games gran theft auto driv starsky hutch priceless  havent tried light gun yet dual shocks unique accessible player game drives shoots decent replay value dont difficulty increased fun beat old scores play unlocked cars suppose finished rental personally find nice own simple games like pop play right away friend shows esp friend not hardcore gamer player game starts feel like gta lite awhile although kids better lacks mature content  mean here half stars little scheme things means good pretty clearly outweighs bad recommend bit enthusiasm star games very rare game made good run cant imagine star game ive too many inherent problems games stars anyway ahem gun very nice game looked forward lot played came hopefully havent forgotten too much positives graphics seems bit controversial people complain frankly sometimes people overrate realism detail guns detail not like dont know half life something didnt repeatedly wow unbelievable todays technology really enjoyed were pretty set scene were extremely refreshing bright colorful open western vistas instead dark gloomy tense industrial claustrophobic filled horror creatures commandos like dont know shooters lovely ride horse around spotting buffalo hot springs such appreciated quite bit difficulty cant remember game had difficulty levels like difficulty levels make bee line easy choice not like dying reload right away not too great games until last part game more later had real problems generally felt clever talented not coddled unchallenged poker too easy though not hunting gave part through thoroughly completed everything else characters voice acting pretty good characters helped superb voice acting dont spoilers here ill quality characters let down storyline still liked looked pretty good game play quite fun varied had best bullet time ever called quickdraw something loved flick target target single button not made feel more impressive raised speed mowing down enemies made less ridiculous beating people gunfight horse riding done very nice pony express liked poker though found bit limited both ranching mining were really nice helped fill world variety things length may exception vast majority games too long feel things become redundant dont finish like gun seemed manageable part pleasantly full finished though perhaps finishing things little too cut dried like every upgrade possible negative story should gone bit lighter mean seemed powerful clint eastwood directed western unfortunatly computer games not capable pulling off anything nearly sophisticated too much plate vis vis game play choice cutscenes acting were nice started solidly storywise progressively deteriorated guess completely unable fufill set gets little hard discuss without spoilers more romance been nice boss battle goes not difficult remember hate irritatingly stupid senseless reality game conclusion wow big negative huge long ending boss battle really bugged really good game though pretty midlevel computer fading fast didnt real technical problems maybe couple ugly frame slowdowns mostly smooth thats know thats worth anyway talking makes sense try game out  xbox live month kit best deal anyone needs sign renew live account headset card itself points bonus game dollars off new game limited time offer easily helps make money didnt include rebate still less buying parts separate fact almost like youre getting headset free like said need live buy bundle someone earlier stated cheaper best buy checked mistaking card kit  game remains favourite games time old school game ive played computer games since had atari cartridge played gta games liked very much addictive trully jewel crown many things dont repeat same waffle great game characters superb voiced great actors ray liotta fire tommy vercetti still suprised got talent seems stone turned blondie gets minor part many thumbs indeed notorious not minors though doubt more minors played adults lot subject matter kicks teh kind amusement seek kind thing never normally wildest dreams part inmo jsut sheer style cant recommend title enough possible downside being picky loading times between various parts city eliminated san andreas run town tommy vercetti  kid not reveal age been playing gta few years has entertained much got version ordering version here rating detail horrible bad good impressivegameplay sorry cant gta vice city has glitches does many glitches game play perfect kept busy hours audio holy sound gta vice city cool radio realistic firearm sounds cars engine pitterpatter shoes wow thats graphics gta has never repeat never took full advantage graphics always been low quality time good enough playable pretty modern missions missions deep affect storyline ways cant imagine involves going around ice cream truck selling ice cream drugs vulgar fun overall possible highly ranked game book hope enjoy too  man sick people mentioning violence cursing sex thats game duh redundant saying sun bright hot dont big deal gore isnt exactly realistic blood splattering gushing isnt great looking ive seen much more disturbing games violence almost like cartoon violence ways isnt really big deal very moderate cursing theres sex yes pick hookers dont action yes theres strip club sluttily dressed women arent exactly real looking people lighten dont old exposed dont buy better not hipocritical buying movie really different watching movies movie fact may worse should relax kid thats being generous enough bulls game great else expect play game hours never bored whatever steal car speed around town run people drive bys rob store kill person reason variety weapons long evade law mission sub mission such paramedic pick hooker health etc etc etc theres plenty side missions those whatll take time not storyline asset missions hardest ones paramedic vigilante firefighter brown thunder pizza boy missions far concerned time limit youre vehicle blows youre ked start again youll take long time getting hidden packages rampages stuff thats not hard not something thats really hard tedious theres race missions tough done persistence controls great drivings excellent foot ones auto aim works easily enough though sometimes target ones dont around without too much difficulty boats harder control though helicopters tricky boats worst since habit accelerating steering controls general good enough pretty quickly used before know youll cruising around town like pro graphics quite nice cars very realistic looking fact playing outside real cars theyll remind ones game youll feel like driving like did game obviously wont youre not stupid ked like guy killed those cops like blamed game making dont listen those holes bunch crap complaints people better blood little better too especially gushes someone shoot like more blood too camera angles main flaw game sometimes youll point different direction youre shooting another problem youre helicopter screwed turn around angle has catch foot youre not auto targeting you button adjust camera angle where youre facing youre vehicles not time really problem though chopper sound excellent sounds themselves nice great voice acting knowns nonwell knowns fantastic dialogue fantastic too youll hear people street talking amongst themselves theyll stuff such tell move sometimes not nicely park car middle flow traffic theyll scream plead lives taunt point gun attack character things people like steals car kills such need greater yours money great humor value game top notch has lot sounds mentioned above fun kill people whatever reason theres reason radio cant believe more people arent commenting highpoints game like gta time dont make own songs bad good depending love cruising around town listening kchat vrock vcpr latter funniest usually listen funniest talk radio obviously funnier music stations though talk djs call listeners commercials like rock music play actually good bands like iron maiden anthrax make own music know make game band actually missions called love fist group drunken scotts radio hilarious not talk radio commercials especially knife dark rated retarded game has flaws overall near perfect makers game basically took did gta added failed really fix few flawss mentioned theyre nothing comparison overall fun game provides least hours youre familiar game play gta try least something close idea gonna complete those submissions easiest decisions youll ever make life buy game thats not enough convince radio characters game jeremy robar says listen endorsements remember people volunteered arent being paid much  playing grand theft auto iii thought rockstar top themselves fact advance word game got actually thought nothing more add gta stupid thought know whole gta bigger badder more audacious gta ever heres story tommy vercetti hitter forelli crime family liberty city finally released prison sonny forelli boss immediately sends down vice city close major drug deal

fashion sense citizens local architecture cars tooling around road youll hear radio stations boast array heavy metal dance latino bubblegum pop music like havent thought since swear try listening radio stations memories dont flooding voice acting usual superb ray liotta did outstanding job bringing tommy vercetti life making otherwise loathsome sociopath strangely likable character others burt reynolds dennis hopper gary busey lee majors fairuza balk robert davi turn great performances philip michael thomas played don johnsons partner tubbs miami vice gets special mention more ways character lance vance keep eye while main story missions take third game itself addition new feature not rounds things adds length game really makes feel like youre establishing criminal empire theyre called asset properties certain point game option buying certain businesses once buy asset properties complete mission strand business start generating daily amount money pick perfectly legitimate such taxi company nightclub others little sketchy like boatyard strip club others absolutely illegal like protection rackets ice cream company car showroom add great amount depth let establish contacts across town needless once sonny forelli comes town check make mistake hes town feel need away indulge inner tony montana book trip vice city like san andreas great place visit unwind like san andreas youll glad dont live there  off ive read secret old clock made game more boring knew basic outline above review adult age loved understand found game overly boring puzzles were too easy driving around horribly done car part game made quit playing says youll pay chores people didnt anything although love herinteractive and love nancy drew games highly reccomend dont waste reccomend getting value pack nancy drew games  wii right around corner people rushing preordered while others including camping worry old school fitting next gen world gaming completely wireless interaction sure sideways wii controllers nes controllers gamecubes happy gotten chance play around wii before anyone else yes wavebird receiptor fit flawlessly under gamecube controller flap wii looks pefectly home rejoice gamers pick wavebirds play  wavebird really take beating dogs house drool infants pick throw still fine plus game lay time super smash bros melee controller still fine button mashing wireless xbox controller feature reely helps wish wavebird min xbox controller automatically shuts self off saves battery too bad wavebird doesnt overall great controlle  excited play game wanted play detective like game unfortunately game very kid like heres example non auto generated task solve puzzles guy simple kind puzzles find childrens word game book easily got except meaning couldnt progress past point problem time didnt not saying bad game probably not good game grownups  sure graphics sound nice game very linear very forgiving too forgiving save reload constantly long arent monsters nearby things made kinda dummy proof cant make significant mistakes result never really felt like taking much chance doing anything dialogue mostly matter clicking responses until cant click anymore theres not much bad consequence clicking order theres really path through different areas game nothing ever respawns adjust difficulty levels very easy very difficult experience treasure dont adjust accordingly means fight too tough couple reloads make very easy still same rewards gotten hard yawn maybe little jaded playing online games like everquest long online realtime games humans playing around much more unpredictable more importantly uncontrolable much more exciting environment play got bored actually stopped playing while close completing very last area game didnt care anymore game requires very little thinking strategizing  bought nintendo play super mario brothers ever like kid amazing brought villans marios were younger old cousin hooked had buy along mario play left home  always loved mario purchased new nintendo lite bought game absolutely amazingly fun graphics sound game itself incredible game good adult child although younger child might bit more difficult possibly frustrating game try harder levels again possibly again every time try again understand something new level really fun features becoming mega mario mini mario mixes things every once while game wonderful definitely great buy  bought game daughter play more does game hours enjoyment love super mario bros  paper idea video game sounds like great idea upon glance seems like firing cylinders featuring major players series reprising roles kiefer sutherland dennis haysbert elisa cuthbert etc storyline tone atmosphere captures feel show game falls apart once further missions repetitive animation graphics jumpy glitched controls unresponsive least targeting enemies chore times analog sticks targeting along plain moving gets incredibly cumbersome thanks camera seems against forgiveable further through more rushed game feels shame too considering innovative series early life everything game had going more polish put game been something special recommended rental fans series  loved game side scrolling nostalgic step time game play difficult times honestly beat game less weeks grad student schedule immunology test middle finishing everything completely levels star coins challenge itself reminded gta series beat game really nothing anymore mushroom kingdom minigames amazing time wasters find myself playing waiting minutes people etc had limited experience multi player very fun friend best feeling seeing stars next saved game getting level wheres waldo minigame  made game fully controlled stylus touchpad make bit wacky sort like mario like mario kart screen map items whenever like jump area area whenever thats really jist game comes new features someone wrote loosely based off old side scroller marios actually very much based off entirely difference environments characters full yet still side scrolling view nice touch watching models move around like nice update old classics especially big mario never much play thanks giant mushroom vice versa mini mushroom causes mario shrink access levels defeating enemy bosses mini mario theres new shell costume mario dons quickly control run fast spins very fun game entertaining not very hard good young folks those reminiscent old days know hard beat mario game surprisingly easy luckily game packed mulitplayer features mini games add value not entirely fun majority make touchpad make not using much throughout game playing player always fun course unfortunately not wifi within range someone else game  guess thing ill got jedi academy before got game hugely dissaponted really liked jedi academy game not great cheat codes wepons amo undying partes game insainly tought many puzzles dont mind puzzles simply many insainly hard recomend jedi knight jedi academy better puzzles arent insain choose like ill leave aredy jedi academy another star wars game sould battlefront thats anoter great game dont game  used remote times before stopped working proprietary dongle inserted controller slot cannot control thing controller must remote control take dongle dvd screen telling reinsert either dongle remote slightly injured malfunction youve wasted thirty bucks feel quite ripped off low cost dvds nowadays much better idea buy standalone imho good progressive scan comes same price side extremely annoying cant turn off device remote must box yourself especially annoying watch dvd bed crash afterwards value proposition offered product very low considering similarly priced alternatives  gta iii rules not greatest game ever thats why gets overall still awesome grand theft auto vice city rules harder xbox version best  castlevania curse darkness game die hard castlevania fan might not much lament innocence wasnt terrible game wasnt great curse darkness goes show castlevania game marches forth has problems sometimes scary problems like lament innocence had much potential good title more doesnt deliver thats sad revelation admit especially having much enjoyment smash dawn sorrow ever since time best symphony night many main characters series like alucard hector curse darkness exception looks little like alucard were not here discuss hector devil forgemaster has given powers dracula dead land overun curse monsters world valachia hector however isnt concerned kind shape world hes more concerned evil devil forgemaster name issac has killed beloved couldnt guess time revenge issac leads hector place full traps obstacles must overcome doing hector slowly recover devil forgemaster skills whatnot story actually unfolds excellent voice acting isnt much story since symphony night weve been given metroid style exploration comes castlevania marvelous once again makes world castlevania explore large castle riddled goodies includes weapons subweapons armour much more playing game quite fun game might guessed spent running through endless hallways defeating monsters isnt boring might perform cool looking combos enemies each must finished button lock onto enemies perform combos makes camera crazy though forgiveable battling without locking actually much better isnt too hard without although steal enemies youll lcok speaking stealing nice actually many time monster leave himself open stealing usually occurs while recovers taking damage again must locked happen likewise unlike lament innocence actually level system words theres actually point battling through hordes monsters time little helper monsters compare familiars found castlevania games like symphony night dawn sorror better comparison pokemon lend assistance gain experience defeating enemies nice not alone castlevania veterans prefer alone each enemy drops evolution crystals collect enough monster evolve wont grow like though thats sad part dont really enhance game play monsters special abilities though golem like creatures open heavy doors imps let bury underground cant help admit nice little innocent devils were actually characters evolution crystal same take advantage system collecting different types crystals seeing little buddies evolve nice things being devil forger make own weapons hector time wants thats right running stupid shop monsters often drop raw materials make new weapons make current weapons stronger simply opening menu dont know thats pretty satisfying able weapons own little downside however exception sword none highly helpful combat start game off short sword youll grow accustomed fast speed easy weapons arent fast enough enemies arent weak certain weapon type makes weapon crafting system little useless points unless youre person likes cool looking weapons opposed swift powerful weapons wont much weapon crafting system except power sword thus experimenting weapons garners fun pretty cool must venturing somewhere isnt draculas castle instead actually venture through world valachia meaning youll trek through swamps mountains valleys lot more youre tired draculas castle quite change problem world dont enough theres not enough detail follow beaten path isnt really different draculas castle lament innocence cant off explore places youre game suffers lament innocence suffered lack detailed enviroments youll doubt run down same path hall corridor several times werent map youd find yourself lost thinking must those looping ares took wrong turn ended running circle monsters not great love castlevania games especially new dawn sorrow much variety thrown monsters attacks theyre same looking monster throw new attack dont expect curse darkness like lament innocence has variety youll run same batch monsters constantly theyll never something new later game youll find yourself fighting nothing reincarnates different colored monsters nothing new likewise monsters youll ever encountered pretty early moment run axe armor youve run theyll never change sound like being picky enemies thing not takes away challenge game fact reincarnates dont anything new makes more true thats not worst part game overall isnt challenge bosses times youve been playing action games youll find more challenging bosses challenge early boss battles game fairly easy later however start hard thats battling actually becomes fun again though youre action adventure pro youll probably beat try wish graphics great hey hector looks great combat enviroments dont enough detail too many simple everyday enviroments weve been seeing long time wheres detail know like maybe leaves tree moving were point where kind interation enviroment instead seeming like were running through still life painting visually doesnt half bad much more bosses cool framerate doesnt slow down isnt enough variety detail however must music sounds aweseome usual castlevania games best music heard gaming better symphony night not isnt better lament innocence either had steller music still among best youll ever hear video game likewise voice acting actually really really good wish couldve heard more curse darkness had potential good game lot things keep down fairly fun game play lacks innovation wont able separate action adventure games got nothing makes stick must game however wait price drop youre really looking good castlevania game suggest getting hold dawn sorrow much better game good great music best gaming good weapon system pretty fun play steal enemies great voice acting bad little innovation lack cutscenes advance story too much game gets recycled too fast too easy game doesnt bad theres little imagination environments not whole lot different enemies too easy boring level designs not enough cant help game has almost

point pick virtually anything world throw around stack gravity gun zero point energy manipulator barrels float water like should explosions suprisingly realistic enemies challenging varied dead bodies flop around like should especially shoot shotgun voice acting very done characters turn move around drawback choppy framerates times highly recommended  finished xbox thought observations might helpful prospective buyers review primarily concerned struggle between getting xbox bought opposing force blue shift came thoroughly enjoyed due xbox price horror stories read having online version decided xbox version did make right choice very good game xbox version represents excellent value money great graphics great sound engaging game play however better game xbox why original much more open ended often more something somewhere found second controls were better configurable xbox found controls really awkward difficult example theres air boat drive direction throttle same thumb stick assume throttle direction separate keys version third theres lot going example several combine soldiers firing explosions fair bit scenery display xbox slowed down almost halt couldnt cope amount processing never had problem assume suitably equipped cope lastly others mentioned didnt very far before saw loading screen frequency saw did become distracting annoying while plus theres weird psychedelic alternative dimension like remember hopping floating platform floating platform plants light went near nonsense has gone away relief reflection gripes more xbox version rather game itself had choose again buy certainly spin off games appear like did not ill wait ending leaves open  half life put box sounds like should core game play still same good fun once few hours graphics decent wont blow away like versian whats problem half life box little watered down single problem really irritates point three stars game loads more actually play simply ruins action middle tense adrenaline pumped chase really suddenly stops game loads loading times last between seven thirty seconds really makes swear screen half life box isnt bad game completley inferior problem had loading problems possibly worth rental sit through constant loading beyond loading issue worth playthrough multi player single player getting dont buy  always nancy drew games not disappoint personally quite enjoyed driving around delivering telegrams reason keep cash flow going tour rest town must admit bit confused why herinteractive wouldnt incorporated courthouse game purpose hey nice penchant detail town doesnt courthouse heh indeed game been designed twice enduring were several ways been accomplished honest enduring does not equate endearing every game has satisfied many levels few levels were left wanting enjoyed going time albeit were few inconsistencies regarding took place turntable revolving wrong however good detective notice faux pas like theres rarely disappointment comes nancy drew games hope continue create games indefintely gripe games wish four five  love playing game icewind dale edition rules graphics great  dvds play perfectly cheap players freeze skip dont play try play xbox dont waste money buy stand alone dvd player instead wont frustration ive had  reviewer below must conflict game currently running game iwd windows make post  game great those enjoy role playing games lot reading involved adds story lot  remote awful quality ive been through past wouldnt complain much didnt cost worth ten people better off buying cheap dvd player rather using xbox  love nancy drew games own every bought game high hopes finished simple yes like nancy drew games were interesting characters amazing graphics intriguing puzzles those good things failed bad game much too quickly problem game too simple seemingly unimportant not much three mandatory tasks were monotonous dull while character switch interactive offered interesting very confusing characters though interesting were not thoroughly developed nancy drew games consider worst fault ending game absolutely horrid far worst games series action chase anything really needed brain quick thinking while nancy drew games amazing series whole game left wondering interactive thinking recommend game die hard nancy drew fans those merely seeking fun entertaining game nancy drew games believe curse blackmoor manor secret shadow ranch secret scarlet hand best  game seemed start off like nancy drew game daughter has played however while seemed thow easter egg hunt three olds everything easy find not mysterious games took daughter quite time before figured mystery however game took days nancy drew games kept intrigued kept coming more game breezed and quite disappointed fact words end game were thats interactive better more interesting game next time youll lose interest  ignore anyone talks games shortcomings fun game addictive game period although reviewer suggests levels too easy goes keep game plot moving fact lets face break tasks down events typical episode arent complex run hide shoot things drive fast chase people looking sounding panting yes video jack bauer breathes like almost were show kiss adage fabulously apt keeping simple game makers kept fun related comment trying make actual game play last hours firstly show itself little loosy goosey real hour commercial breaks creative liberties secondly each hour broken smaller missions learning takes each section take little time thirdly those choose complete missions finesse higher scores find theyre not coming closer hour theyre having more fun theyre acting more like characters show suppose someone wants complete missions quickly avoid shooting anyone instead run past enemies better yet reviewer really wants take hour thing seriously surprised isnt complaining being able save progress memory card really ought asking game thats played straight entire hours saving right time like show  seems like huried game too much running around answers phone did not web acsess actually did not like all  daughter played previous games weve enjoyed overall games fantastic challenging fun game quite lame comparison others puzzles werent really puzzling boring tasks were not many clues find werent many clues real sense detecting anything game ended abruptly very short did not walk through solve mystery record time experienced lack challenge did like newness becoming frank joe hardy occasionally rest pretty boring looking nancy drew game try others instead  like people played game primary motivation playing through watch mini season story takes place during considerable gap time between seasons show actors show voicing characters music script written guys real show should not been too hard please game respect game fulfilled did not exceed expectations while enjoyed watching extra game play left lot desired quite bit variety nice play almost every character show were many different types missions standard point point while shooting people missions made game rest game involved driving computer hacking interrogating sniping such really cool missions were actually fun pretty much mission involving driving sucked since controls were incredibly sloppy interrogation kind fun time didnt need done several times were three four different computer hacking missions got done over again werent much fun end game rest game describe mediocre wasnt anything spectacular game play were too many missions where environment dark impossible where going reason missions involved shooting down helicopter addition were too many missions were unnecessarily difficult opinion such mission playing jack defend girl defusing bomb basically endless supply terrorists keep rushing start shooting girl takes damage starts whining stops working wouldnt nearly annoying werent fact doesnt seem strategy whatsoever beating mission must made dozen attempts varying degrees success idea did differently finally beat pretty much mission involves protecting another person extremely annoying person usually tend stand open taking damage instead finding cover despite fact partner firing weapon constantly never hit single enemy take everyone yourself game worth playing through story youre fan show otherwise find much better action games there  review bovey spot games gotten more boring majority game spent looking same shells over make same necklaces over much enough real sense scariness danger boredom game short suddenly ended disappointed games become loved final scene liked blackmoor manor though never finished without consulting walkthrough game lame dont recommend paying full price  youre looking nba game dont know shall sort through good bad offered both nba live nba between played live honestly nba better buy ive had countless hours joyous moments frustrating however nba more around basketball game youre good offense poor defence chances good wont win many games might youre good defence horrible offense wont win much either basically play game altogether based star level fans offensive minded games further nba live basic controls straight forward easy hang wont real problems newcomers series such myself best aspect featured live undoubtedly freestyle superstars favourite team ers allen iverson pulling off moves does real life game nothing short rush another highlight youre left wide open shot chances extremely good youll drain whereas still basically had perfect release overall each game nba steals youre looking allen iverson player matter theres question youre looking hes got tattoos cornrows mustache everything nba live hand almost tends childish times dont wrong graphics dunks awesome youre dribbling upcourt cant help players arms too long course seems more realistic courts without shots fans though nba pros fantastic game play more play more learn making game invest time graphics great turn difficulty actually gets hardernba cons offseason legacy mode kind lame too frustrating times team run nearly impossible hit anything lay loading time almost ridiculousnba live pros easy anyone pick play freestyle superstars commentary lot better dunks fairly easy execute make excellent highlightsnba live cons camera angle horrible far too offensive minded almost too easy times fouls called too liberally youso fairly unbiased view each game live were drop down highly recommend reality really fun play not sure worth every penny plus has great street ball mode addition legacy mode did live ever really chance  know absolutely hate people game hard beat normal week came twelve years old around maybe thirteen anyway game fun got week came christmas vacation brothers were glued computer playing game least watching play beaten game five times never gets old  ive been fan games since secrets kill came ive played not sure whats happened games though while graphics steadily improved puzzles plot game play really gone downhill game secrets kill had pretty horrific graphics story compelling were fabulous puzzles things really picked second game stay tuned danger better graphics very interesting story very cool puzzles great plot absolutely recommend games stay tuned danger message haunted mansion treasure royal tower final scene secret scarlet hand ghost dogs moon lake danger deception island secret shadow ranch games similar length interesting puzzles lots areas where snoop around really enjoy game haunted carousel interesting has wonderful graphics awfully short did not enjoy curse blackmoor manor found too difficult cannot really recommend secret old clock too short repetitive did somewhat enjoy last train blue moon canyon danger design were nowhere near quality earlier games terms plot puzzles outstanding graphics too short amount repetition puzzles order advance drove completely crazy dont mind nancy running doing errands help people thought games had perfectly balanced like each task different interesting not mind numbingly repetitive boring seems factor more recent games delivering telegrams game painting pictures game finding seashells making necklaces game miss looking clues putting together evidence purpose miss puzzles actually woven fabric plot advance game seems like repetition might said game took number hours complete miss learning useful things learned american sign languagein learned chinese symbols san francisco earthquakein learned latitude longitude sextant worksin learned much maya ham radioin learned roman numerals prohibitionin learned make invisible writing learned ham radio pacific northwest sea animalsafter didnt really learn very much anything useful later games youve never played nancy drew game please please please yourself favor start earlier games although probably not very graphics arent good switching discs highly annoying try wont disappointed please interactive please used structured gladly sacrifice improved graphics meant regaining plot cohesion integrated interesting puzzles  three years later buy game wow awesome cant believe runs three years release everything looks feels great games purchased and not had return due being messed corrupted file happy thought play multi player anymore seem always games going yep game suggest gamer  game has minute introduction story square enix really creative stories good however expect put something like skip intro cause impatient people really mad stories however game every five months fine minor flaw another flaw map statistics wait seconds until appears very annoying again minor flaw game depends much like battle same creatures over again very boring awhile train those dumb spirits sometimes level quicker game gets very boring awhile ditch game characters not much action limited amount monsters battle terrible bad average good great must buy excellent graphics great sound voice acting great fun depends patient react battling same monster over again average grade goo  had read pretty good reviews game bought hoping something little action interesting storyline got probably boring game ever played introduction prolouge lasts minutes including credits cannot break move set down psp grab drink find short battle play story characters long annoying conversations press end each sentances again break game menu manage game through each painfully slow dialog box until chapter game really bad maybe gets little more interesting possible actually something besides watch characters argue really slow storyline dialog does not appear freeplay played type game before enjoy style play might like bored frustrated minute  pretty much sums felt minutes introductory waffle hellishly annoying bingy bongy music admittedly very pretty cut scenes totally emotionless voice overs impossibly slow conversations served little point honest point either switch off psp throw against wall decided switch off big fan adventure games played untold legends till gave literally left hanging around nothing more quests offer gather game graphics valkyrie minutes though seemed like much longer seen really cool character graphics bit like tekken game graphics those horrible munchkin japanese rpg graphics game stuff bit play looks like years old should gba cutscenes nice doubt far too many those minutes slow cut scenes every encounter cant proper review couldnt stand title long enough actual game play theres sitting through intro again advice like long winded old style walk talk three hours before actually doing anything japanese rpgs better still antiques shop find old text adventure prefer game where actually play character stuff avoid like plague ive got high hopes dungeon siege comes had high hopes valkyrie too untold legends okay not good should been helluva lot more fun valkyrie like point ive never played xbox game cube time ive seen valkyrie profile game didnt preconceptions obviously had never gone anywhere near title place  xbox dvd movie playback kit very easy set plug little receiver controller ports put dvd enjoy buttons remote responsive easy used however xbox dvd system very simple doesnt eject buttons something mentioned many times reviewers not many options more expensive stand alone dvd players keep mind made people already xbox dont shell extra dvd player has lot special features able watch movie dvd itself runs exactly good stand alone dvd player sort like those little digital cameras isnt anything really special take good pictures put computer  purchase xbox console dvd movie playback kit matches region located buy dvd kit put dvd infrared sensor xbox

customer care department end hold correct  star wars jedi knight jedi outcast third game star wars dark forces series introduction ive pretty much always been fan star wars may guessed fan many games based series although star wars games often hit miss succeeds usually succeeds beautifully interesting ideas star wars game dark forces released playstation although game itself horrendous terribly choppy framerate very poor level design something world had never seen before star wars person shooter sequel jedi knight cleaned lot problems added new innovations third game series jedi outcast has arrived like previous games sub series has gotten multi console release read fares overview jedi outcast star wars person shooter game has player quest several different multi player modes review put simply game everything original dark forces should been while not perfect game huge improvement predecessors once again play role kyle katarn agent dark forces titles second death star has been destroyed many imperial forces still fight infiltrate hideouts exterminate graphics part solid impressed good kind game nothing state art theyre still pretty damn good control has been given overhaul rightfully since game lets force powers wield lightsaber single player mode extremely entertaining fact game offers multi player options adds overall value package save whenever single player mode course game isnt perfect like earlier dark forces games level design not good too many areas alike too many instant death spots too easy fall likewise many cases objectives unclear puzzles pain dont know buy person shooters shoot people not solve puzzles imbalanced puzzles often poor level design took hour beat level another huge problem availability lack custom control configuration plagues game huge problem since games limited control selections often clash youre used sort game game wasnt released consoles very high quanitites youre likely gonna shell full new price used copy mind not worth price sad true recommend game star wars fans warned not perfect hard copy edition notes good game strange reason wasnt available consoles very long used copies fetch close original new retail price extremely annoying people like every star wars game still should hunt down youre sort thing overall overall best game dark forces sub series thusfar where game succeeds succeeds beautifully impressed game shame consular version not made readily available players strongly recommend game hold doubt disappoint star wars fan  game fun best lightsaber combat ever hard times force powers ing fun cut everybodys arms off like frist star wars movie cool man cool  early game pistol rifle take down stormtroopers new republic explore base force powers events make turn worse luke request lightsaber begin discover force powers search dark jedi killer girlfriend rest game amazing graphics increddible duels game simply magnificent plus multi player awesome especially play ctf team boat load storm troopers friend being rebels bot helping against twenty stormtroopers makes game game youll never trade plus duels fun play again again five stars game does three puzzles quite difficult great game starwars fan must own shooter fan really has like both oooh need really bad  game too simple too short like creature kapu cave better danger design while appreciate quality graphics sound effects music seems like producers nancy drew games changed hands recent years were seeing stark difference newer games compared past games such shadow ranch danger deception island treasure royal tower etc those games fantastic recent games play not fluid tasks too simple minded theres not much mystery suspense game play time too short creature collect shells make necklaces fishing long until bored beach water graphics cool humor character conversations enjoyed move between four locations intertwine make sense didnt problem auto switching via cell phone calls between nancy hardy boys not problem almost rated star gave due graphics characters variety locations hopefully interactive hear customers disappointments revamp upcoming games fans nancy drew games keep coming  love idea behind game pretty impressively exectuted had three gripes though fast paced found really difficult progress past third procedure couldnt magnify reduce quick little circles caused great frustration theres skip through seemingly endless pages character dialogue repeat procedure couple times quit playing pretty quickly  introduction isnt boring isnt long best introductions game made enix dont like omg min wste dont buy another rpg long live rpgs supposed stories different dont like take refund dont play rpgs like cant stand words play gta something wait theres words too  valkyrie profile rpg came during later days psx while never achieved massive success went become rpg classic has garnered very loyal following fast forward release awesome rpg psp however dont make mistake writing off plain old port valkyrie profile lenneth includes new high quality movies help immerse story graphics consist highly detailed sprites pre rendered backgrounds seen vivid psp screen makes game downright beautiful combos awesome battle system mix real time turn based fighting surprisingly intuitive newcomers old pros problem getting used glance might simple progress through game youll find depth makes quite fun main story itself very developed rpg doesnt follow traditional linear telling things enjoyed game character episodes collect new soul help battle save valhalla enjoy rpgs feel adventurous enough highly recommend buy game definitely must psp game  great remake wheres fast forward kingdom fast forward button great game cut scenes were nice touch helped draw player story line someone please fast forward skip button understand makers game involved appreciate storyline without fastforward skip button game game has limited replay value already played through game once running through again going insane long cut scenes seemingly endless next clicks were fine time game has different endings figure developers break said lets review character development magical items while definitely not unique helped flesh fight scenes combos skills moves made game interesting kept coming while liked graphics slightly change different equipment used swords helms etc combat special moves graphics were definitely nice should buy sure like rpgs game definitely buy fore warned prepared read read read click click click before fight scene expect much same long before things own  game mindnumbingly hard not very challenging rather set fail missions thrust situation little indication patients vital signs drops frantically poke trying nurse assists gives vague ideas before know youve failed mission take average failures before finally won mission last mission played made quit resulted failures thats being hour half game graphics crisp clear storyline didnt make much impression probably too frustrated pay attention game had lot potiental killed constantly making fail not buy game unless extreme amount patients game collector keep sealed youre gultton punishment whatever not buy game hype does not live  know pelican screen protectors styluses tempting theyre always cheapest ones available should tell something top screen uses adhesive smooth plastic middle edges leave sticky goo screen edge different material middle insanely difficult squeeze air bubbles being adhesive trying again again isnt much option furthermore sticky edge white not clear looks horrible onyx lite having much difficulty top screen protector checked online reviews read several reports people used pelican styluses pelican bottom screen protector screen protector being very drastically scratched within hours worth whether stylus too harsh bottom screen protector screen protector too flimsy stylus combination doesnt many people report simply throwing pelican write protect sets trash not paid pelican money something thats going trash matter inexpensive pelicans product still too expensive end throwing trash too know going avoid pelican screen protectors styluses future very much wish were reviews here amazon before bought mine had dig through nintendo forums read peoples opinions finally already bought hate remove using scotch tape edges peel off rubbing alcohol remove residue  game seriously disappointing disappointing didnt finish second case before setting down forever highly entertained cute funny going around clicking things new user highly entertaining however quickly got older cant skip through horrendously long dialog ever youve heard million times youre clicking people hopelessly frustration unable figure found myself looking internet walk through yes simplistic game couldnt figure click wandering around hopelessly thirty minutes reading dialog youve read thousand times gets too frustrating typical patience level possible spolier seemed glich second story talked wrong person wrong time never ticket planetarium couldnt take more gave places people never change each case understanding exact same tiny few places not big gamer like world bigger three feet let friend borrow thus far enjoying more help review college age female gaming console although ive played quite bit maybe really hit miss dont really recommend anyone someone high patience level really high patience level  yeah game really fun gets extremely hard times towards end little hours kind short guess each mission might take few tries complete plus fact might spend tries like did easily best games though everyone should collection  game creative really atypical really exciting  gamecube weak owned both nes nintendo those were excellent gaming systems nintendos recent system gamecube has several problems design internal fan slow quiet hour system overheats thus shuts down second problem wireless controllers system suck tried brands none worked more week brands tried pelican intec nintendo osmart third problem system not built last still nes nintendo both great doubt gamecube last past years simply put dont buy product nintendo wii going soon description specs need stand interact move around stuff game sounds fun like hard something like sony eye toy  game fun injoyable bonus levels questionable almost better less people  main reasons decided become gamecube owner due ability play gba gbc games external source television projector universal screen etc care less inability play dvds had already owned playstation afterwards started using less game boy titles more game called super smash bros melee former floormates used play almost time stand watch system itself cube shaped hence name gamecube like original xbox comes four controller sockets controller similar appearance smaller not better controller like playstation uses memory cards store data unique gamecube handle unit making easier carry furthermore purchased variety colors platinum black purple colors imported though recommend finding store does paint jobs giving thats north american cant help feel somewhat cheated whatever reason comes video games machines dwellers always deprived really neat things like panasonic gamecubes built dvd players gamecube game boy player bundle deals playstation nes axe colors tri star adapters game boy hunters availability systems multiple colors etc interestingly enough ive found problem prevalent mostly nintendo sony systems whoever said life isnt fair sure wasnt joking panasonic had ever been released system had lest been available more colors here without having import unnecessarily tedious complicated excessively costly procedure probably gotten something closer star range due respect nintendo start showing little more consideration respect americans kab score super  son has had many happy hours game came extremely quickly transactions were very easy  husband bought five old daughter preschool graduation gift hasnt been able leave alone shes little more advanced world gaming age definitely better mom cant recommend every kid kid adept box should enjoy doesnt hurt loves movie well  bought daughter box bought christmas not owned game system except game boy since original nintendo came game has been fun play same time makes family fun daughter able play alone without getting too frustrated does play personally enjoy comedic elements been thought hard core gamer probably bored quickly may not challenging like gotten half through without cheat book amazing games  supposed box cleaner system does not read disc shoddy product  huge fan rpg genre played every morrowind boring ever played turned off evenings slowly walking around having stupid repetitive conversations npcs lamely fighting rats interface

youll soon learn much actually against brawl becomes more frustrating should cumbersome control scheme adds not mention controls quite buggy graphics sharp distance game has odd like doesnt know wants

elasta girl fun everything else either blah made swear lot hopefully second game better ill renting instead buying game left disappointed overall  shouldnt people know never buy movie games friend mine bought horrible too easy die etc etc etc hey listen keep money investment isnt here  graphics pretty imbarasing object game snapshots snapshots completing missions levels hero times specific mission were character levels fun like far far away level has grand theft auto theme graphics should done better job main characters audio game play fun overall  vertical stand wonderful why useless dvd cases duck tape put slim vertically helps why waste time buying product bought kicks literally  poor quality box play almost useless very dispointed sell game  gripe customer said were differences between disk versions information false time origional release fortunate high end computer time able run windows version had much better graphics character illustrations beyond upset found nothing dos version bought play windows version knowlage does not past win maybe those played been waiting play windows version very upset  loved game child spent many hours playing incredibly excited able play laptop oops didn update drivers games kings quest minutes playing cant screen due graphic errors patches available yet dosnt like feel pretty ripped off says cover big print runs windows barely not very does interested game check vivendi has done patches before buy disapointed better yet download fan made editions free online work  incredibles fun player game puts role being incredibles though short pros amazing characters great graphics intresting plot footage movie accessed through game artworkcons short playeroverallif loved incredibles big screen like game same plot characters great visuals much not very lengthy  game fun play not greatest game either course movie better game game pretty easy short considering levels storyline beginning been alittle better missions pretty hard pass tough ones gets easy again good game recommend graphics good like put storyline movie not bad game play  know feel incredibales movie incredibale game dismays movie dash faviorte character forced run around levels avoid enemys violet running around invisible elastigirl probaly best part game swining around end level father beatin bad guys plus stupid voice frozone gets kindof annoying awhile wasnt whole point movie famile teamwork theres team youre self playing charcter per level please note movies made games  hype game bought opinion felt flat face game simply not very intersting storyline plain boring rpgs better simply immersed story line quickly battles boring extremely quickly since kinda point tap same guys over costumes decals kinda stupid many said next earthbound not not close nintendo has much potential game does not deliver graphics sound game play fun dont wrong game not horrible means defitnetly not good either check reviews before buy  second part xenosaga compares very badly stellar part regardless anyone says longer wanted play game minutes game begins lots boring instructions very non intuitive battle system annoying amount experience points needed defeat nearly every main enemy including very battle result saving screens painful chore battle camera inadequate characters act like small puppets game has very few items weapons armour deal ordinary enemies stronger expected skill combination successful main enemy not available until engaged enemy battles main enemies long isnt such problem however often conveniently power end battle frustratingly finish off battle weakened party voice acting very uninspired sometimes annoying dont remember music game plain character changes likely upset least half everyone liked xenosaga very noticeable swearing main reason dont enjoy watch hollywood movies during rest relaxation anymore new meaningless characters been introduced story focus shifted far away main characters cover character hardly says does anything time short scene between main characters during critical moment blink miss game far more frustrating challenging not good game trait dont recommend playing game before reading above fully prepare disappointment awaits youre looking forward anything made xenosaga great extremely disappointed second xenosaga better completely avoided  loved xenosaga arrived episode isent bad game terms story intro absolutely dynamite battle like tactical stuff good game youre trying fight through hoard enemies save point record timing save money gone amazingly done battle system episode place stands completely nowhere new battling takes minutes rid couple easy enemies easy ones game around hps ridiculous thats not enemies weak zones depend height attack input zones being highest triangle square circle sometimes mean completely screwed become deeplyaddicted game understand full potential wasnt enough changed voice actors too kos moss voice sounds more like operator robots momo sounds like brat least chaos voice has improved prefer playing episode twice playing hope namco comes better sequel otherwise spend moey something else like shadow hearts example  pros mechs bigger part games actually graphics cutscreens great graphics overall better before couple characters better much harder episode more optional bosses cons new battle system load mouse spunk spunk characters worse especially kos mos jin travels throughout space pants almost sidequests terrible very short story much weaker dictionary gone shions glasses shops why shops too much more list bad movie howard duck better this  got game free box corn chex thought fun since show cool got home played annoying theres like black screen before question shows black background dont buy fun  better game made adults kids sly sneaky humor adults understand greatest toy ever created legos theme best star wars movies many games put replayability allowing through game missions second third time different character lego star wars does fashion totally fun not simple regurgitation map different character wihoo replayable rather ingenious method rewards additional pieces building secret areas were previously unobtainable instance might need stormtrooper uniform jedi dark light bounty hunter enter specific areas droids often used access areas usually during missions using free play mode through missions character created character unlocked during mission cycle through characters abilities allows unlock new areas find additional bricks etc fact new abilities characters find later new areas explore really makes replayability fun worthwhile another aspect game absolutely love cooperative play great adults able play along kids spouses wife doesnt play lot xbox titles loves playing game blast going through missions together surprised more games dont actually coop play like seems enough toss death match label game multiplayer complaint camera both single cooperative mode often times camera shift based players force player towards center screen more occasion has caused death characters stuck forces players swap characters midstream sometimes isnt obvious player been really nice option split screen especially real estate hdtv provides highly recommend game especially kids spend quality time great game  disney interactive released wants millionaire early anticipated very warm response disc had firm low opening price however actually being played game sure depress isnt crudely simple design poor uninspired entire game essentially based lackluster thing regis philbin repeating same phrases over again sure wants millionaire hope youll join again wants millionaire doesnt decide resell simply trash game within week purchase disney interactive regis themselves dont waste time pitiful effort  though daunted little reviews stating problem installing game went dont regret bought platinum edition installs right good thing platinum edition three games same time not very bests available category interesting fun graphics though details not great still liked view specially view through eyes main character hero story dialogs specially bad fact follow certain clues talk people find useful information good idea sort combination rpg rts like units fight picking artifacts weapons good overall nice game platinum edition specially good lots hours game play  extreamly dissapointd game every section mission exactly same exception location absolutly skill involved beating game able sittings  hey ever played caesar yeah game basically knock off game better graphics quite frankly caesar more fun dont civcity has point build city nothing interesting ever happens progression game keeps fresh makers intergrated technologies wonders successful civilization game series inconsequential game people should stick good civilization series leave city games people know ive heard new installment caesar series caesar havent tried has better civcity rome game boring dont pay money  brought having played caesar loved wanted something bit more scope controlling dynamics city thought being civcity game offer extension wrong bad rip off caesar sure graphics more advanced zoom view playing same game less involvement control sit let happen game keep people happy build everything theyll stay caesar thats youre wanting looks like everything sets itself isnt feel like ive wasted money  really looking forward game prepared overlook things every game has own personality right found instead game actually doesnt much didnt mind graphics not cutting edge sure not bad either little muddy change cartoony hard enjoy closeup views however many buildings lost roof zoom toggle feature camera angles were frustrating very difficult pick anything mouse accurately not much time scenery immigrants came came came whether were houses jobs available not long city happiness high enough meant everyone happy were not had houses jobs keep city happiness ensure somewhat stable economy forget planning forget balancing resources workshops markets wasnt clear balance case take trial error didnt time were building worshops like mad trying guess many citizens employed each researching temporary bumps keep city being deserted droves best income boosts were not through sale goods trade through research maximising tax base development currency hit those early reached certain population level made money rest time spent trying keep people leaving stability reaching level quickly became game keep control immigration set pace development decorative options more similar games really didnt care end city looked like cost time money too really not relevant issue unless people were unhappy stick few things quickly somewhere cant enjoy leisurely pace planning building finishing off nudge here watching run constantly involved process staying ahead curve dont worry maintenance such city fires engineers cities cannot not made self sufficient self sustaining inherent instability built game play five ten minutes away screen bring cities not screeching halt while enjoyed research options ability move homes thought great innovation not having ability control flow immigrants city pegging success city happiness makes game poor economic simulation game play ultimately very shallow unsatisfying  ive never played real time strategy games before primarily play rpgs game combines best elements both ive enjoyed playing immensly forward playing part completing couple more times different characters  essentially platinum edition dvd three games bargain bin price couldnt pass had little trouble getting launch little internet session world rpg rts hybrid excellence seamless integration elements makes truly unique experience unlike rts games many adventure

rune hero moves towards ultimate destiny sum dvd has plenty adventurous rts rpg action wrapped around engrossing fantasy yarn should provide dozens hours quality entertainment highly recommended  civ name has been tarnished analogously thing been learning sid meiers name product doesnt mean product good case civcity rome unfortunately doesnt modestly good comes dismally poor ive tried hard not let influence beliefs civilization general civ came starting believe firaxis games sid meier regret inform great civ titles were made long time ago offerings today simple pattern production rushed title came major bugs games add unnecessary features designed justify overall cost consumers often abused ridiculous expansion packs containing features should obviously been included original release take advantage love franchise pattern evident whole sid meier civ franchise degenerating almost seems especially release civcity rome once again expected simply drop cash new products based love old developers not living expectations producing great games stay away civcity rome besides obvious blunders associated bugs best patch cannot make graphics good narration sound effects better interface properly game dismal failure sorry report seems like firefly studios had idea got license firaxis cheesed watching maxis sims simcity franchises firaxis civilization franchise doing loyal fans like watching dad drunk  has pretty much been said lets again cause sure firaxis firefly plant positive reviews here game takes ages load voice acting silly british australian hermans hermits progression totally linear game fails become more complicated higher levels graphics date citizen fetching system completely random opaque sit watch awhile huts change size every thirty seconds importantly boo sid boo couldve produced bad caesar ripoff called anything called civcity put tiny civilopedia havent got enough money civ series brilliant dont cash  games faults been covered already ill roman era city builder looking save money wait ceasar afer playing demo far superior game civcity every level seems game makers civcity were trying make failed miserably  worth money lots hours yet closr warcraft civilization style gam  had old skool released lite skeptical right microsoft scandal critical new technology wanted wait until had been few months pick had glitches glad waited released coral pink picked adorable perfect ability change light levels great old hard play outside couldnt really adjust lighted screen soft pink color glossy tiny marveled size compared old super hot charger old does not fit lite old charger old car charger wont thats not such big deal since comes charger kinda sad old car charger wouldnt fit stylus better soft rubber tip instead hard plastic old had colors amazing sound pretty loud find dont very much hear fine glad nintendo finally realized not every gamer  like reviews find game rip off caesare iii didnt know must while graphics admirable game play wasnt challenging didnt take time win worst game players ever otoh good afternoon waster build perfect city open play goals dont buy wait until cheap like something  swear wasnt liked final fantasy much break game move happy cant waste money thing kept game fact didnt waste money game makes kingdom hearts like rated game god childish know final fantasy games try make main character cool didnt feel like doing monkey man stupid plus character more dumb looking main happy beat put awful exp behind ahhhhhhhhhh  graphics arent important part game already owned oblivion bought gothic hoping darker more mature oblivion style rpg while does much more mature content oblivion never got bad controls bad collision lack fun bad collision talking character walking through getting stuck objects weapons find tree branch tiny dagger easy enemies fight level character little gremlin looking guys cave pond beginning totally beat crap ease controls make combat unfun chore patient forgiving gamer gothic barely has half quality elder scrolls oblivion youve never played oblivion dont xbox run maybe youll gothic has much lower system requirements  nintendo lite introduction late nintendo premiered nintendo dual screen nintendo short despite skepticism many critics fans alike new console quickly won audiences nintendos best handheld console date nintendo released smaller lighter version system appropriately called lite overview nintendo released lite mid new version system smaller old version features repositioned buttons switches etc variable brightness levels few changes classic retails comes three colors white black pink review nintendo did good job revising many problems older version system fixed here highlights flaws new version good smaller more compact original original rather bulky comparison handhelds market kind pain haul around finally weve got smaller lighter version system easily transported variable brightness levels adjust brightness liking version brighter levels more battery power lower levels less plan best batterys life features clip game boy advance slot unlike original lite version includes clip goes slot where game boy advance games fit helps system streamlined appearance keeps slot cleaner compatible reader old due shape couldnt reader accessory lite models shape better around available three cool colors whether white black pink theres color everyone repositioned buttons things nintendo made system more convenient moving buttons around spots easier redesigned stylus new stylus bigger thicker ones old around improvement compatible older since basically same system wont compatibility issues bad smaller isnt necessarily better every big hands fit old fine shrinking actually makes little harder aspects buttons still not compatible pre game boy advance games course wasnt really expecting nintendo fix still not compatible game boy advance multi player another thing wasnt expecting fixed overall overall nice improvement original problems part same problems original had havent gotten yet definitely lite model edition notes lite relatively new should stores years  people doubt find nintendo lite nintendo sucker people money yourself sucker lite little better simply put youre content original dont waste time buy dont period lite much better investment original bulky lite game play made little simplar button placement brighter screen make game play little better start select buttons been moved resemble where were original gameboy advance makes handling functions especially gba games lot easier buttons sadly still little small guys big hands like myself lite comes phony gba cartridge called cap dont gba game plugged system put phony cartridge keep collecting dust however stick gba game sticks centimeter looks weird cap does least keep system looking good perhaps welcome change lite screen original screen not exactly bright fact comparison lite rather dark games like metroid prime hunters were darker had new screen difference bright games appear really shows not adjust brightness need doesnt really affect battery life either play lite long played original like original charges while play another welcome difference touch screen itself screens last lot longer original those original doubt experienced lot scratches screen stylus point where noticeable still screen apparent stylus doing number screen more protected here stylus doesnt scratch screen quite easily words touch screen lasts lot longer lite looks better fits pocket better performs tasks regular example youre playing game suddenly flip closed sleeps theres place store stylus stylus better too little bigger thicker not quite easy lose problems original still plague lite however still cant play gameboy color regular gameboy games lite still cant configure controls play gba game much easier words cant configure play gba game probably wont bother long run however touch screen still has sensitivity touching touch screen bare hands more dangerous stylus scratching screen oils fingers might damage screen therefore wont respond touch stylus original launched owners note were not very many good games availible good game during launch super mario plenty games not ports great time lite better investment original far may not play movies players honest almost defeats purpose gaming system looking buy portable entertainment center course not looking find system play games nintendo delivers real gamers know games not bells whistles system casual gamer nintendo delivers lite fine improvement good vastly superior original fits pocket easier screen much brighter touch screen more durable placement start select buttons easier better stylus battery life unchangedthe bad those original lite spend more money yet another cons original still her  controls very difficult understand wanted realism killed lot fun making damned vulnerable everything long time gamer handle tough game frustrating extreme plus people talking immersion dont couldnt myself care world story didnt grab like games  bought game strength reviews here very dissapointed clunky control system really put off  concept game strong got cute ideas voice recognition especially word blue character recognition abysmal makes game exercise frustration more anything else character recognition unless write whatever font game programmed recognize going record answers something different wrote penalized system doesnt recognize blue correct number system rigid accepts saying blue system should sound file tells wants hear number recognition should screen shows system wants numbers written should able allow enter numbers correlate numbers within system make mark intro content absurdly long skip huge waste time youve seen got game today ive spent hours trying figure blue such game recognize wish return opened software very frustrated entire experience  everyone seemed really excited game supposed great launch title etc turns red steel fails deliver like dominoes during hurricane graphics meh ubisoft done better controls bit awkward isnt wii controller itself having played zelda wii sports controller works very very inclined bulkiness shooting red steel fact using sword more like clubbing baby seal fighting grace master samurai has game design not fault controller storyline isnt amazing either pretty straight forward neverending quest save girlfriend brownie points got pop culture reference shoot lot japanese people process nothing innovative here move along been lot better selling ebgames getting trauma center instead disappointing launch title  wii game got mostly couldnt hold zelda red steel looks promising certainly controls good feels more like game thats supposed used using remote nunchuck attachment tutorial sorts problem isnt much fun deal play scott man japan girlfriend suddenly find father yakuza mob boss hes got tons enemies girlfriend gets kidnapped save ultimately getting yourself involved family struggle pretty simple stuff game told through voice acted cutscenes graphic novel like storyboards graphic novel storyboards interesting really painful cant skip cinematics storyboard cutscenes especially annoying die listen same objective over again red steels appeal game play seems focus game controls solid part again whole game seems like tutorial used wii remote remote aim enemies button shoot nunchuck allows pick weapons reload said weapon tip tables youll know accessed has golden outline around nunchuck youll move around strife side side move forward nunchuck allows jump duck youll doing lot ducking remote responsible game play allows turn side screen another game itself help adjusted tutorial provided beginning game grifriend directing fish youll able remote several things lock onto enemies button hold button zoom enemies moving wii remote closer screen zoom pretty cool remote extremely sensitive slightest flick left youll left great actually point shoot enemy accuracy really important whether not hit enemy granted controls take time used flow particularly swordfights another story though annoying sequences actually mostly controls clumbsy youll swing sword using wii remote youll parry dodge attacks using nunchuck fun limited fighting swords cant pull weapon bad youre middle firefight guy has sword youll forced sword fight enemies using guns still theyll still fire youll lose health theres sword fights either thats really annoying controls feel clumbsy especially extreme sensitivty game plays credit interesting things starters youre not shooting someone youre ducking behind something health refills makes game seem easy understand youre taking damage shooting health doesnt refill doesnt make game incredibly easy sword fight youll choice finishing attacker off sparing life sparing life earns respect learn more techniques game doesnt fantastic not bad looking either visual presentation alright part graphics lacks games numerous bugs glitches moments where youll staring enemy right face wont move wont flinch attack stands waiting killed sometimes enemies run right past claim cant youre plain sight moments where shot enemy neither nor comrades acknowledged existence probably more bugs found within game hard take while couple annoying aspects game play hold weapons time isnt annoying sounds wish couldve held more luckily ammo not hard glitches such bullets passing right through enemy while takes enemies shooting through walls game full wish sounds good doesnt voice acting very mediocre soundtrack isnt great either levels sound good theres nothing memorable here red steel has good control scheme going thats really has going not fantastic game means bugs glitches strewn throughout really annoying hard recommend game die hard person shooter fans good control scheme works lots actionthe bad tons bugs glitches found throughout whole game enemies dont attack walk right past enemies cant plain sight bullets going through walls through enemies game full detract game play sword fighting clumbsy wield weapons once youre forced sword fight theres until fight horrible voice acting theres really story controls while good seem like another ploy used wii remot  been staunch final fantasy fan years while waiting newest release kept being pushed tried xenosaga let tell grateful game entertaining interesting games ever played world absolutely amazing characters unique not mention plot has profound depth fall love trust looking rpg draw keep playing hours xenosaga  really wanted like game unfortunately blows trade migraine game play pretty horrible sword scenes reminiscent adventure games circa where press attack key swing sword aimlessly bad guy runandgun part game nothing write home either feels like being teleported body cracked legged drunken monkey know graphics arent wiis strong point excuse regress bit youre trying shoot someone across room really sucks cant tell apart flower pot lawn chair cut scenes were obviously supposed like sin city stress word supposed cause were probably strung together poor intern development team went hiding like amateur flash slide show kinda like local momandpop video editor put together little nephew had gotten had sin city themed bar mitzvah game joke anybody associated should embarrassed  playing icewind dale reminds those novels written american authors late century though many novels were very written never seemed suck continue reading book icewind dale like looks nice supposedly improves game play gives player more character creation options dont really play why end seems icewind dale hurt extremely corny story bogged down numerous irrelevent puzzles involving running around constantly not fun predescessor bought game reason reason addicted baldurs gate needed expand party based rpg addiction another realm icewind dale seemed logical option wrong immediately confronted story corny almost embarassing take part confronted game play caused run forth place another constantly confronted battles easy soon bored tried play again again plagued same problems installed bunch unofficial patches those did not solve problems terrible puzzles whatever else overload puzzles corniness diverge path baldurs gate where accomplish quests order wanted here had accomplish everything linear order never diverge path furthermore story seemed retread story original icewind dale fact design game seemed paralell completely final problem game concerns fact difficult play knowledge dungeons dragons rules not know rogues unfamiliar feats like game pose very high learning curve may not climb mostly familiar rules easy someone did not know easily make mistakes unfamiliar certain classes though rule book pretty exhaustive not good game baldurs gate icewind dale instead game  firstly been big fan aurora engine based rpg games loved plus iwd sequal found honest awful raised edition rule set never played exception nwn fact game based newer set rules didnt bother much computer game exact mechanics system dont understand thing did bother game fact big battle another commanders send endless suicide runs got point where simply leave game runing hour while chacters hack slash through tide randomly spawned criters got boring really fast not too mention difficult really sad part read general plot outline enthusiastic always wanted happen orc races banned together army attempted invade companions ones front lines against army point where pen paper rpgs tell fellow hiring shove  war has erupted between humans alien life force known gnosis man danger nothing done soon thats where shion uzuki designer anti gnosis weapons system known kos mos comes game has splendid opening really gets thinking life itself subtitle book written philospher anyway start space ship creating ultimate weapon against gnosis however before completion gnosis attack ship kos mos starts herself herself basically thrown around different areas exploring multiple storylines trying figure why everything happening graphics game similar anime game characters big googly eyes little cartoonish especially shion thats really sets mood game though battle system really unique unlike tried basically physical ether like magic attacks choose guard during turn gauge allowing extra more powerful combo once level lot youll gain more powerful end moves allow defeat stronger enemies youre not limited characters agws units basically mechs really not disappointed game loved better rpg yes ffvii great game collection highly recommend  hello uhh theres not really much card yeah keeps online another good bucks long very cheap yeah buy online online people add tag smiling bob  image took those aspects mmorpg everyone complains lack story constant level griding stingy monetary system stingy experience system quests require faq completely stupid party members nutshell ffxii like starts though strong characters beautiful graphics good playablity game had stopped hours shined great game more hours grinding subquests neccessary past point where theres almost story fact story gives strong indication shouldnt actually doing story wants truth told game terrible said done rediculous ramping difficulty game progresses absurdity license point system very concept buying routines party isnt hopelessly stupid still generally completely ruin experience once final fantasy series standout line console role playing games mighty fallen not worst rpg market easily worst franchise worst past couple years play final fantasy games instead complete pass  lack balance thing pointed problem lack balance battle system good attempt sounded great paper didnt pan has been mentioned number enemies speed enemies took away battle monotony enemies left wanting during area game sandsea had chain wasnt trying chain points either matter good battle system designed same enemy row gets boring license system seemed more like dumbed down version sphere grid ffx loved sphere grid wasnt fond system obtaining experience through battle increase abilities made success requiring abilities bought made failure level penelope had cleared magick section grid although highest level magick cura hardly impressive skill storyline like riding snail too many cut scenes not enough interesting developments gil distribution down right ridiculous leveling hours exploring every nook cranny dungeon still not having enough money improve weapons wasnt good balance needs healthy dose risk reward keep interesting past games leveling fun progressing story felt like necessary chore ffxii nearly every enemy remember got license point per kill rough estimation enemies need killed clear section licensing system last rant character classes lack character anything carry weapon necessary price while openness good makes rather boring characters excitement getting new skills class completely lost vaan gets new axe basche right behind note mentioned weapon special abilities unique character either between lack rewards gil ability increases experience monotony battles not recommend game put hours game completely lost interest midway through hunt mini games bland rewards completing hunt nothing excited comparable defeating difficult enemy previous games believe make decision whether enjoy game rental naturally another person may like everything ranted above like game hate learning curve previous few hours become addicted lost interest middle addiction stage  take moment address battle system license system systems while conceived completely ruined game example license system itself very good idea allows player craft character liking tastes problem lies execution example learn steal not license purchase game presents problems game example characters possess suite licenses cannot shops dont carry particular item system gives flexibility snatches away requiring not license find item cant help feel hobbled license system items require licenses discrete parts game developers cunningly shot difficulty doesnt matter earned license shield fire level level offered shop game very challenging precisely mechanics prevent characters getting better normal equipment earned license sly artificial developers ffxii ramped difficulty strips away seems almost arbitrary unnecessary cap three playable characters time straw breaks camels lastly battle system opinion isnt fitting console rpg feels like playing world warcraft city heroes enemies always faster nigh impossible chase down always able catch fighting bow exercise futility enemies catch game freezes place during firing button allows flee borders between being useless outright deadly while fleeing game prevents interacting objects flee toward door stop pause let hit before escape mouth gaped open saw reviews game online game received astronomical scores heralding best final fantasy ever shocks beyond belief ffxii better mmorpg sharper player rpg single player game shoddy mechanics game plays like tumbling rock perhaps too old school game tastes too much like lollipops bubblegum mileage may vary  price card cheaper stores point pay shipping express office depot ones shipping card not amazon much ship tiny card thin packaging joke  game looked crazy couldnt resist mean disney squaresoft trying merge final fantasy load disney cartoons must seemed like cool idea japan since love cartoons much usa insane top voice talents mandy moore lance bass production values knew had ridiculous games history hardcore fans were bothered looked like kids game arent games supposed aimed children teens anyway ultimately disappointed kingdom hearts world characters kingdom hearts not really final fantasy disney crossover place kids control little melodrama like idea disney meets final fantasy takes seat once past hype kingdom hearts boring frustrating nagging issue tiny areas game planet alice wonderland consists four small rooms course spend great deal time fighting off monsters combat blend chaotic button mashing watching party members act like total fools until die worst respawning monsters cant take step without having fight fight hoards shadow munchkins had defeated youll spend majority money healing items bosses nightmare since hard survive take forever kill minutes normal since combat simple really makes drawn battles beyond boring beating bosses done game know kingdom hearts mushashi samurai legend final fantasy same combat woes wish squaresoft learn respawning enemies bosses million hit points thing past  site cheapest found card not pay live service monthly credit card alot cheaper buy cards every year  nintendo has dominated handheld industry since gameboy came sony has stepped predicted hold might finally breaking not better proof lite lite evolutionary step original similar gameboy advance has more compact form factor brighter screens side mounted power button weighs less has longer battery life simply looks more fashionable basic functionality still here same buttons general button layout gba compatibility etc worth buying already maybe youve got spare cash worth buying dont own definitely design far superior old review complete without further mention psp while psp undoubtedly more capable device has significant weaknesses compared particularly psp games tend far longer load times has much shorter battery life hardware itself more fragile course theres cost critical factor however library games available games more better theres simply contest comes has more offer department games really make break console wide variety excellent casual immersive titles make clearcut winner  while own game makes great wifi ability play friends spent couple afternoons friends house several people playing mario kart against each fun time full excitement people yelling either being knocked dead last managing squeeze win last second touch screen great addition games allow either touch screen standard controls used depending preference others like mario kart stick standard controls others require touch screen creating very unique kind game lite improvement while may not worth upgrade already worth lite better shaped has better battery life better brighter screens lite certainly great handheld console  before anything played game beaten week provided blockbuster grudgingly playing though unbaiased opinion game completely stupid sequel retarded again opinion  really not tell anything still not recieved game despite having paid month half ago  please promise never play not worth time paid money try find person gave money kick shin hard throw copy game dumpster seriously though game absolutely terrible graphics bad psx combat quickly becomes boring hell story line confused fact second dimension pointless reason being something characters were exactly same statwise were poorly designed annoying thing world bar nothing having equip characters spells whenever switch characters like spell slots god dont need those crumbums square couldnt pull another hit oversized victorian tophats wanted too should really stick straight video final fantasy anime movies lest risk making something like again  time white option red pleased child more ive found games claim wireless attachement not communicate games lite reasonable size perhaps slightly larger buttons nicer offer pink black nice exchangable covers been nice stylus barely managable adult hands fine child screens bright longer dimmable backlighting turned off nice feature many games allow amout play another partner doesnt copy stores like gamestop often kiosks allow download demos different games thats nice cannot keep demo thru power cycle thats bummer biggest pain yet not found cable communicate between lite does exist power supply cable different while less bulky better layout lite steps further away accessories worked between versions not lite such proprietary really like more adult software things not far pda audio recognition handwriting well  game played gamecube spongebob battle bikini bottom absolutely loved daughter plays over thinking shrek similar rented very hard control stick kept zooming wouldnt rotate camera except certain times charactors were very distant used stick zoom still wasnt close enough same feeling needing put eyeglasses something more clearly another aspect didnt like four charactors always together lose track main charactor maybe were spoiled stick spongebob allowed rotate every direction around graphics were good facial expressions surprising reviews good impression completely opposite  loved incredibles excited play game ive been playing video games last couple years off really beginner perhaps explains enormous difficulty ive

however must classic rpg fan bonus finally got play chrono trigger  good collection better emulator fast cut down lag course such options arise mentioned lag issue played through snes assure horrid lag has faster drive form caching titles helps dramatically means removes delay chrono trigger console fights started discernable lag creatures background jump youre fighting visible delay beyond

aesthetics were minor annoying flaws game further contributed displeasure button press often counterintuitive often found myself pressing wrong button game badly needs journal destination guide know where once spent hour doing nothing walking around space ship trying figure where  far worst instance overzealous copy protection ive ever experienced bought game new local store ive been itching play simcity game not new video card got game home installed fine came time launch game said disc authentication failed tried disc failed again went companys support forums found lot people same problem had done anything help thankfully people store were very reasonable gave full refund  dont buy unless starforce malware computer understand publishers wanting prevent piracy not expense replacing drivers need dvd burner check search engines yourself otherwise been great game too bad isnt playable malware  starforce nothing else need said starforce singlehandly has destroyed number great games dont know since not single play dell xps gaming laptop  bought game sounded like lot fun tried installing dell laptop dice not run tried installing dell desktop computer again not run went knowledge base technical support lists integrated video card game not system short counter system cannot run game computer find ridiculous disappointing not suggest buying game until technical support page requirements game play especially since little facts not listed box  anyone has ever played original know whole point kingdom hearts beat stuffing heartless nifty weapons known keyblades time around beat stuffing heartless new brand villan known nobodys compelling story line great voice acting donald goofy act sound like dsney versions kingdom hearts delivers every aspect game play except summons love game dont wrong felt really added couple more summons mix make battle system much more fun original had roughly summons together has square adding couple final fantasy summons game play cough cough behemut either great game final fantasy disney fan should pick  liked original like finishes story nicely battle commands improved especially like reaction commands still has camera issues overall good game  game sucks tries sim city extra features unfortunately graphics below average fact screens like were designed art student interface clumsy not intuitive big fan sim city series game really falls short  liked like  such excellent game why stars fun rating very very fun game parts annoying aggravating seems different levels difficulty achieved handing less less health upgrades kinda cheap ask physically limit instead strategicly doing everything else great graphics great not excellent great sound great too gameplay excellent story very developed kinda easy side normal level though guess nothing perfect ahead worth costs  end sands time trilogy marks successful return style fun prince persia sands time thrones combines good fighting mechanics warrior within downright utter enjoyment sands time sot started years ago story picks where left off prince returning home babylon before know sands time make comeback prince left peril order save kingdom great platforming tasks insane jumps crazy obstacles here sand powers found iterations gameplay same part new speed kill system quite fun may find eases fighting difficulty quite bit being said not always easiest thing pull off especially multiple enemies involved cool addition none less graphics better ever slight improvement remarkable improvement sot jaw dropping years ago rendered cut scenes good sound clear including voice acting where original actor sot has returned voice prince does great job again really adds overall quality game music return orchestral sounds eastern decent hard rock has left building much acclaim game very linear people may stray away multiple tracking like however enjoyable start finish new chariot races interesting may find slightly place boss fight particular cause many frustrating moments few times perhaps dozens studying patterns getting attack down becomes problem did experience glitch caused game freeze certain point several times searching around message boards seems common problem able past resaving save point file word advice least few different save files along journey dont start anytime ending completely appropriate trilogy leaves hoping prince return game little short side around hours complete seemed shorter previous great game must play anyone enjoyed previous fans third person action adventure owe yourself play beforehand though story beginning end experience epic adventure  game has starforce copy protection software not computer reportedly replaces dvd drivers often causes extreme hardware software problems ive been victim software problems basically crippled very expensive scsi scanners extremely difficult figure doing best game thats ever been produced anyone whos had starforce experience going steer clear  actually recieved friend mine bought anyway said were television shows thought were interesting were sold told max region dvd reader took home decided buying series region recieved today surprise not actually damn thing didnt stuck region dvd nothing play extremely disappointed product buying reason reads regions dvds dont buy product junk however thankful didnt buy product given hope someone planning buying reads review not worth money  found game many tried codes thing actually action replay basically twenty dollar more waste plastic cardboard came avoid like plague  third installment since rebirth classic series presumably final chapter sands time saga thrones takes best elements sands time game warrior within sequel caps franchise style finesse game play sharp scimitar blade once again assume mantle nameless prince persia returning home babylon long last find ruins people war army sand monsters prince finds himself company old friends old enemies cursed comes find body soul split periodically wicked self known dark prince rises forth wreak havoc take control princes body storyline entertaining characters more developed video games strikes nice balance between darkness light heartedness something warrior within failed achieve essence took tone presentation games rolled together mentioned before game play not far either while sands time set tone acrobatic platforming remains pretty much tact warrior within took games weak combat mechanics fleshed something little more interesting happily both elements retained improved upon new installment whats more tenchu like stealth kills available while theyre far perfectly executed sometimes seem unresponsive nonetheless offer fresh twist opportunity avoid hand hand combat many circumstances dark prince another significant addition regularly throughout course game prince transforms alter ego sand monster version himself able weapon called daggertail weapon functions much like belmont whip castelvania game allowing dark prince attack enemies swing poles light fixtures access new areas prince couldnt hope reach while stronger prince combat unfortunately dark prince must sustain himself constant supply sand power succumb death been used makes portions game more intense rare occasions little more frustrating new series chariot trials sequences during prince must escape via horse drawn wagons through hazardous environments full speed ahead while provide nice change pace actually occur relatively few trial error nature lead irritation few glaring flaws thrones sound effects ambient music retain inconsistent buggy feel too often dialogue sputters repeats like broken record music kind fades departs little rhyme reason graphics suffer pretty blatant clipping problems engine has aged pretty gracefully has aged least character designs architecture long keep distracted occasional failings visuals prince persia thrones many respects very similar game before therefore not novel game longtime followers doesnt feel long tooth might stage thanks new game play additions entertaining continuation story certainly better game warrior within more welcoming almost every series has lot life thrones

eventually end such star wars series lord rings trilogy jak daxter trilogy not including racing game daxters own psp game excellent games favourite elfin friend furry sidekick last entry jak trilogy big question good ending pleased overall yes jak takes place undetermined time conclusion jak haven city has become divided relentless attacks robots metal heads nasties population blames jak problems finds himself flown wasteland harsh unforgiving desert where nobody survive without help abandoned those saved jak buddy daxter set thier final adventure like predecessors jak platforming game combined gun shooter various jumps kicks punches leaps wide array firearms take foes fancy kung karate arent enough jaks moves remain largely unchanged jak called still punch like man jump like kangaroo leap like bullfrog gunplay remains pretty much same four guns blaster rifle machine gun peacemaker nice twist each weapon gets various upgrades game goes rifle example starts default setting hower next upgrade allows shoot richochet bullets while third upgrade gives flying platform shoots bullets directions each gun has three upgrades playing blast peace maker example fire shot paralyzes enemies makes float around whee while final upgrade lets youll shooting mini nukes lot biggest change jaks game play comes form vehicles while had flying vehicles zoomers jak has cars not nice talking pixar kind half game set desert jak daxter around dune buggies eight each has various unique traits really really fast jump riddiculously high wheee spin control slightest twitch control stick boo youll spending lot time driving buggies part enjoyable fun though such sand shark bit difficult handle another new feature jak sheer size had enormous areas run around here not not three yes three gigantic areas run around like previous games loading times astonishing feat considering enormous both worlds spargus city wasteland haven city youll definatly lot amazing sights during trips throughout jak world such haven city has ahem changed since last game dark jak powers return balanced new side hero light jak dark jak attacking force light jak defensive force dark allows kill things really quickly while light allows heal fly awesome surround yourself inpenetrable shield slow down time crawl both powers activated time long light dark eco meters very nice touch stop being light dark touch button save energy really need while both light dark play vital moments during game play both really little added bonus spice game play play throughout game without needing either force except scripted moments where need again being able heal yourself whenever very handy thing smile like jak has going place place talking people doing tell finish head next person etc linear system makes easy tell where next sounds fairly restrictive does big strength dont start next mission until wander around wasteland blowing wanderers twenty hours hunt down twelve precurser orbs watch sun down three times tackle mission free roaming system allows youd like dont feel like doing missions while thing like address before further difficulty level takes review find lot anger hatred directed towards naughty dog making unnecessarily hardest game ive ever played still tied spider man very pleased naughty dog towned down difficulty lot jak longer does each every mission require twenty attempts before pass longer throwing controller while screaming obscenities becuase hole errol won fricken race again here difficulty seems right not too hard not too easy missions require few attempts before completed few finished try still few quite difficult grit teeth inducing overall nothing infuriating many moments previous entry series few through ring missions time around thank goodness addition free roaming game play plenty secrets unlock quest precurser orbs find collect jak doing unlock various features such unlimited dark light jak power invincibility extra vehicles various weapon upgrades etc while hidden behind corners many orbs collected doing various challenges people throw such searching around paticular area going through rings grumbles following little blue light stopping time plenty things those little shiny orbs results worth addition jak arguably has best moments series terms wow factor fighting gigantic sixty story tall monster dune buggy moment sends shivers down spine fine points jak does stutter little bit arguably important part game story memorable story had many twists turns never really knew expect next story jak good does keep interest going happen next ultimitly left unsatisfied three biggest ones charachters precursers ending those worrying going tell precursers wont going keep spoiler free off charachters jak daxter course those always fun watch care many returning charachters such torn sig samos new residents spargus city problem almost returning charachters zilch charachter development assumed know last game jak takes time explain may okay pretty much none charachters expanded torn still gruff tough not much last time ashelin firm leader samos gives warnings may happen planet things badly keira such vital charachter has absoloutly nothing story aside pretty important sig hes hes cool returning charachter kept interested tess fufills dumb blonde role relationship daxter sweet lighthearted kept interest easily errol returns though wont hes gone insanely irritating average irritating sad departure compellingly egotistic nature new charachters damos kept interest due charachter tough yet gentle caring same time hes easily compelling jaks new companions new villian count veger isnt compelling though does very powerful scenes especially near ending claims game box discover shocking secret precursers really said earlier wont reveal precursers someone did ruined suprise except personal opinion should never find precursers were leave mystery personally felt seeing really sucked suspense mystery esepcially since been talked length games like revealing face doctor claw experience old memories more mystery wonder anymore personal opinion beings should remained hidden forever however saddest part game ending again wont ruin always sad game developers wrap entire trilogy three minutes people criticise ending film return king saying goes too long however ending lord rings film trilogy took time wrapping threads three movies bringing closure story leaving satisfied however jak doesnt game goes gets closer end feeling dread idea everything destroyed vanishes pretty much gone time final boss battle comes sadly battle itself isnt exciting memorable ending does end trilogy leaves door wide open more games already happened ive invested lot time three games ive grown attatched charachters like closure thier stories saldy doesnt happen everything left wide open opinion should been closed real ending here least ties everything nicely despite points story stress jak very good game satisfying blend storytelling platforming shooting driving action those games where keep saying five more minutes five more minutes discover time has flown morning addictive fun blast play definitly recommend especially find under twenty dollars  bought party bundle boyfriends daughter birthday loves game has been weeks mic dead started static while while singing died completely know not great singer not bad  stars very low number compared good game light jak freakin awesome awhile really attached game course charchters themselves must buy anyone looking non stop action game  intro jak ending jak daxter trilogy pulled off quite nicely few flaws game nothing major start jak exile haven city people distrust dark powers taken people wasteland story continues gameplayonce again jak moves very fluidly nicely has exact same controls last game except certain new powers like light jak once again animators done wonderful job making lush detailed landscape characters sunsets sunrises done nothing looks cut pasted walls like spyro era games like game move between haven city wasteland more terrain explore last game additionally control light jak powers thought nice twist nice add something new people enjoyed dark jak option thing personally irks took away keiras voice actor barely speaks does not same person least keira had role ending felt little dragged towards end game hoping finish soon instead prolonging more crammed missions pros conspros nice characters glitches far loading times detailed landscape new powers old dark jak light jak good switches between areascons blasting people monsters over annoying ending seemed pace snail overalla nice finish series bought youll definitely drawn anyway  bought mic december nights singing completely died complete disappointment save money  present brother dont know like said best person game box  game has outstanding graphics great game play plus really battle online instant action add few play clone wars galactic civil war bad thing though clone wars main battles naboo honest clone wars started geonosis episode not love game guns awesome weapons play wookies clones droids rebels imperials beginner video game player new star wars choose create file try using easy game follows movies really explore mos eisley maybe naboo like more battles win bonuses read instruction booklet says killing spree

really enjoy playing game great love try playing yourself wrap review listen game great xbox has terrific gameplay features play time though online single player still fun know star wars action game great love playing know battle front games soon three enjoy playing buy buy every thing star wars  ill admit being able around stormtrooper kill everything sight fun wicked fun game delivers good time playing fps involving star wars major drawback game targetting like using sniper rifle halo reticle size assault rifle turn auto aim option help accuracy reticle tends follow enemy screen more difficult shoot allys shoulder another drawback cant jump fall shoot same time like fpss plus fighters hard learn vehicles still fine footsoldier nice vehicles were little easier use  game simply put not good got bored tears playing ended giving away robbing useful space desk slow paced predictable not suspenseful fact characteristics probably why mainstream though laughable comparison real person shooters dont belong consoles owning game means average player true fps gamer knows childish pathetic garbage while rest hype many successfully deceived themselves thinking worth anything isnt
