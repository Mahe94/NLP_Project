+ Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow is the latest iteration of Konami's decades-old franchise and the first to appear on the Nintendo DS. Don't let the title fool you; this really isn't the dawn of anything, except maybe a bunch more Castlevania games on the DS. And the subtitle here is simply a workable way to include the letters D and S in the title of the game, as seems to be the requirement for the platform at this point. Dawn of Sorrow actually takes place a year after the events in Aria of Sorrow, which came out in 2003 on the Game Boy Advance. If you've played that game--or if you've played just about any recent Castlevania game actually--you'll be right at home with Dawn of Sorrow, because it's basically the same game repackaged to fit the DS. That isn't a bad thing though, because the Castlevania games have long carried the torch for good, old-fashioned 2D side-scrolling game-play, and Dawn of Sorrow keeps that flame burning as bright as ever. The star of Dawn of Sorrow is Soma Cruz, the young adventurer who narrowly avoided becoming the next Dracula in Aria of Sorrow. Soma has the ability to collect the souls of monsters he kills, thus inheriting their powers. A year after Soma escaped Dracula's castle, a mysterious woman named Celia shows up and attacks him. Celia is a priestess of a new cult that is attempting to resurrect Dracula. Since Soma already proved once before that he's capable of foiling the resurrection of the dark lord, the cult decides to eliminate him before he can mess up their plans as well. Soma survives the attack quite easily and Celia is forced to retreat. Apparently Soma doesn't take kindly to people who try to kill him, so he sets out to find Celia and prevent her from reviving Dracula. The entire game takes place at the cult's base, which is a replica of Dracula's castle. In true Castlevania form you'll start off relatively weak, with only a knife and some mediocre armour. As you progress through areas of the castle, you'll fight monsters and search the maze like hallways where you'll gain experience, as well as find new and better equipment. As you gain experience, you'll level up and your stats will increase in attack, defence, strength, constitution, intelligence, and luck. Throughout the game you'll also collect the souls of monsters you kill. These souls can be equipped to give Soma new abilities. There are three types of souls you can equip, as well as ability-type souls that grant you special powers without having to equip them. Ability souls are collected when you defeat bosses, and these abilities are usually required to progress through the game. By using these ability souls Soma can learn how to double-jump, move underwater, and break crystal blocks--all of which are required to access certain areas of the castle. Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow sticks close to the tried-and-true formula, so it will be an instant hit with anyone with an affinity for the sort of exploitative game-play the series is known for. While it doesn't do much to distinguish itself as the first Castlevania on the DS, the updated look, excellent music, and added controls help to refine the series even further. The bottom line is: Whether you're familiar with the series or not, you can't go wrong with Dawn of Sorrow. 
+ The game-play and overall feel of this game screams Castlevania. The side scrolling platform action is spot on, the graphics truly push the limits of the DS, and the variety of equipment/soul combinations will lend itself perfectly to creating a game-play experience perfect for your style of play.As people have said in past reviews, the use of the touch screen feels tacked on. To defeat bosses you have to draw symbols on the screen, which can be frustrating if a) you have poor penmanship, or b) are left-handed (such as yours truly) and have to scramble to take the stylus out, switch it to your other hand, and draw the symbol. It's a neat little addition but, again, it didn't really need to be there.Also, the boss battles are sometimes a little too easy, even in the later levels. Don't get me wrong, there are some that are just downright nasty, but some of the bosses fire off their special weapon and all you can do is look at the screen and go "... that's it?"Overall, this is another great game for the Nintendo DS. With the exception of the clunky touch screen add-on, the game is overall fantastic
- First off, I cannot believe how mad this game has made me. I like all kinds of games, but honestly trying to figure out some of the levels in this game left me stumped.  It's one thing to be stuck somewhere and have to retry a lot, but several times during this game I was stuck in an area and had no idea where to do/what to do, etc... even after I killed all the bad guys I didn't know how to get out of the room.  This game is not intuitive (so?) at all!Secondly, this game should not be called the Incredibles, it should be called Mr. Incredible, because you play as him almost all the time.  Playing as Elasta-Girl is great, I really enjoyed that part, but when there are a lot of baddies with guns, Mr. Incredible is a pain since he has no way to block anything, so you spend a lot of time getting pushed back until the bad guys reload.I liked the first mission as Dash (when you play as Dash, which is only twice) you have to run fast; however the second mission I just lost my patience because I had to restart about a million times because I couldn't see what was ahead of me.Playing a Violet was bad, they should have done a lot more with her instead of a boring stealth mission. The Incredi-ball mission Incredibi-sucked, it took me like an hour to hit something because it was in a difficult place.I'm just finishing up the game now and quite frankly I haven;'t enjoyed a lot of it, which is a shame because I really loved the movie.  Some of the levels are too hard because you can barely find the way to do something and Mr. Incredible needs to do more than punch people.  Currently I'm on the Rocket Silo level and I keep falling down trying to get onto a platform.  What a load of fun that is to do 100 times or more.  Bottom line:  Playing as Elasta-girl was fun, everything else was either blah, or made me want to swear a lot.  Hopefully the second game will be better.  I'll be renting that instead of buying, this game left me disappointed overall
- Shouldn't you  people know by now?Say it with me:NEVER BUY MOVIE GAMES.A friend of mine bought it and it was horrible.It was way too easy to die in,etc,etc,etc.Hey listen.Keep you money.Your investment isn't in here
- I bought the KR Party bundle for my boyfriend's daughter for her birthday. She loves the game, but it has only been about two weeks and the mic is dead. It started with the static for a while, but then while I was singing, it just died completely. I know I'm not a great singer, but I'm not THAT bad
- I bought this mic in December and after only two nights of singing, it completely died!  What a complete disappointment.  Save your money! 
- This game was originally released for 10 dollars. Almost everything about it is pulled straight from Diablo and is not quite as good. Though this game has a few things about it that are interesting, and can be enjoyable to some people, I would just skip this game and go for Diablo 2
- This game is, simply put, not good. I got bored to tears playing it, then ended up giving it away because it was robbing useful space on my desk. It is slow-paced, predictable, and not suspenseful at all. In fact, these characteristics are probably why it's so mainstream, even though it's laughable in comparison to real first-person shooters, which by the way don't even belong on consoles. Owning at this game means you are an average player. Any true FPS gamer knows what childish, pathetic garbage this is, while the rest just go with the hype. Many have successfully deceived themselves into thinking it's worth anything at all. It isn't
+ I really liked this game. I'm 14 years old and mi in the high school.... but when mi bored I seem to play this game ALL THE TIME... I don't why... I WOULD BUY IT IF I WERE YOU!!!...VERY FUN and CHALLENGING AT THE SAME TIME!
+ I love this game. My daughter and I are big Ratchet and Clank fans and look for games with similar play.  We found that in the Incredibles game.  It's exciting and challenging. As we get playing it , I wonder if it is too easy at times, but then I get to a spot that I can't accomplish until I do it 10 times. My favourite thing about the game is ,  after conquering the first level as Mr. Incredible, you then get to be Mrs. Incredible, Dash, Violet, etc.  Great fun
- I used to love this game, but there are so many better games out there, plus this game is overrated, with a not so good storyline, and nerdy weapons, it's just not good
- the vertical stand is wonderful... but why? you can do this with 2 useless DVD cases and some duck tape... I put my PS slim vertically and it helps but why waste the time buying the product? I bought it just for kicks... literally
+ This mic is very durable and is wired good, haven't had any problems and is much better than the headset
- If you're looking to spend money on this, don't. Having spent my teen years holed up in my bedroom on a Commodore 64 (and being the current fan that I am), I was really excited when I heard about this product. Unfortunately, it stinks. There are a couple of games on this contraption that are real gems, the rest being mediocre at best. The overall bad choice of games isn't my issue with this thing though. It's the CRUMMY JOYSTICK. Control is horrible. The stick is clunky and unresponsive and makes playing a real chore. As someone else pointed out in their review, often it doesn't even respond when pushed in a certain direction. I can't believe it's 2006 yet these companies releasing plug-n-play video game contraptions can't even make a decent joystick! A real let-down
+ If you're going to play Karaoke Revolution, this is the mic for you.  I now have 2 so that my wife and I can play in duet mode.  It's much better than the headset.  For just 17 bucks, you can have a 'real' mic that feels so much more natural.  If you play KR a lot, invest in this microphone
- Not as much fun as I remember. Maybe better if they had a better selection of games (One on One, Hardball, etc.
+ I am so glad I purchased the Logitech Mic for PS2.  The quality of the sound is awesome, and my kids are having a blast with it.  The price is reasonable.  My kids take very good care of things, but I'm not so sure that it could withstand any mistreatment.  I will probably end up buying another one
- I purchased this product for my niece,having had positive experiences with similar items,and finding the price to be too tempting.However,what had been the hope of introducing her to the video games of my generation turned into an exercise in frustration from the outset.The screw to the battery casing stripped with very little application of a screwdriver,the titles suffered from redundancy,and many of them required the use of too many buttons.What was the most disappointing aspect of this item was the potential it possessed; perhaps fewer similar titles and a re-configuration of the button commands would ensure the promise of this product
- I was really excited when I saw this item was out!  I had the Commodore 64 when I was a kid, and my brother and I used to spend hours and hours playing games on it.  I was so glad to see that Winter Games and Summer Games was included.... until the item arrived and I plugged it in and tried to play with it.. the joystick doesn't work at ALL when you move it to the right.  So, you can only use it to go up down or left. BIG Disappointment.  Don't waste your $$
- This second part of Xenosaga compares very badly to the stellar first part, regardless of what anyone says.  I no longer wanted to play this game after only 30 minutes.The game begins with lots of boring instructions for a very non-intuitive battle system.  Annoying amount of experience points is needed to defeat nearly every main enemy, including the very first one.  Battle result and saving screens are a painful chore.Battle camera is inadequate and characters look and act like small puppets.  The game has very few items, weapons, or armour to deal with even ordinary enemies, which are stronger than expected.  The skill combination that will be successful on a main enemy is not available until engaged by that enemy.  Battles with main enemies are long, which isn't such a problem.  However, they often conveniently power up at the end of the battle, just to frustratingly finish off a battle-weakened party.Voice acting is very uninspired and sometimes even annoying.  I don't remember any music from this game, so plain it is.  Some character changes are likely to upset at least half of everyone who liked the first Xenosaga.  Very noticeable is the use of swearing, which is the main reason I don't enjoy or watch Hollywood movies during my rest and relaxation anymore.New, meaningless characters have been introduced into the story, and the focus shifted far away from the main characters.  The cover character hardly says or does anything this time.  There is one short scene between the main characters during a critical moment, but if you blink you will miss it.This game is far more frustrating than challenging, which is not a good game trait.  I don't recommend even playing this game before reading the above, to fully prepare for the disappointment that awaits.  If you're looking forward to anything that made the first Xenosaga great, you will be extremely disappointed.  The second Xenosaga is better completely avoided.
- I loved the first Xenosaga. Then, this arrived. Episode 2 isn't a bad game in terms of the story, the intro is absolutely DYNAMITE. Then you get into a battle. Now, if you like tactical stuff, this is a good game for you. But if you're trying to fight your way through a hoard of enemies to get to a save point in record timing, I say save your money. Gone is the amazingly well-done battle system in the first episode. In its place stands a completely out-of-nowhere new way of battling that takes 15 minutes to get rid of a couple of easy enemies( the easy ones in this game have around 2000 Hps). Ridiculous, but that's not all. The enemies have weak "zones" that depend of the height of the attack that you input.The zones are A,B and C, A being the highest. Triangle=C, square=B and Circle=A -SOMETIMES-. See what I mean? It's completely screwed-up and you have to become deeply addicted to the game to understand its full potential. And if       that wasn't enough, they changed the voice actors too. Kos-Mos's voice sounds more like an operator than a robot's and Momo sounds like a brat. At least, chaos' voice has improved. I'd prefer playing episode 1 twice than playing this. I just hope Namco comes out with a better sequel, otherwise spend your moey on something else (like Shadow Hearts, for example).    
+ It has some flaws, you will have to run around a bit between play areas, but it plays well enough.  The price is right, and it is worth the time you will spend on it.  The learning curve is small, and there are music sound tracks buried deep in the CD if you look for them (a neat extra).  It has been around a couple of years and there is nothing new (though you do have a "partner" you can exploit during battle), but it is a good change of scenery.  I liked it enough to want to finish it; I think you will too
- Pros:- Mechs are a bigger part of the games (you actually have to use them),- The graphics of the cut screens are great, and the graphics overall are better    than before,- A couple of the characters look better,- Much harder than Episode I,- More optional bosses,Cons:- New battle system is a load of mouse spunk (can I say spunk?),- Most characters look worse (especially Kos-Mos), and Jin travels   throughout space with no pants on,- Almost all of the sidequests are terrible,- Very short,- The story is much weaker,- The dictionary is gone; and so are Shion's glasses,- No shops. Why are there no shops?- Too much more to list.  Just bad.  The movie "Howard the Duck" is better than   this
+ If you like Diablo 1..... this is exactly the same game... only improved 300% percent. If not for Blizzards Bnet and all the multi-player options I would say that this game is also better than Diablo
- We got this game free in a box of Corn Chex. We thought, Oh this will be fun since the show is cool. So we got home and played it and it was so annoying! There's just like a black screen before and after the question shows up and a black background. Just, don't buy it if you want to have any fun
+ I'm not a big fan of the Diablo/D&D type game but this game is really neat. The one big advantage of this game over Diablo is the ability to control 2 characters in one game. Very high replay value also makes this game a winner. Pick up a copy if you can; I've seen it rather inexpensive at local retail store. For the price, you can't go wrong
+ I just recently bought this game for about $10 dollars.  I had always heard is was awesome but had never even played an xbox(I've been a PS2 fan for a while).  After I played the first couple of levels I was not disappointed.  This game is simply amazing even today, I can't possibly imagine how good it must have seemed back when it came out.  The game-play is terrific, and so are the graphics.  The sound and music to the game is awesome.  I highly recommend that this game is bought and not just rented because it is well worth owning
+ Halo blew everyone away when it came out because no one was expecting it and it was one of the beat looking games of its time.This is definitely a good game to play if you've never played a first person shooter. Also if you have an Xbox, you should get this because it is awesome.Ratings Graphics, Then:10, Now:7 Sound:10Replayability:6Controls:10Drawn In Atmosphere:9Fun:9Multiplayer, Co-Op:9, Multiplay:
+ Just so everyone knows.  I mean, there are probably only a few troglodites out there who wouldn't be able to figure out or at least guess that this...oh, never mind.And don't even bother hitting the "was this review helpful" buttons over this
- When Disney Interactive released "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," in early 2000, they anticipated a very warm response to the disc, which had a firm but low opening price. However, when actually being played, the game is sure to depress. If it isn't crudely simple, the design is poor and uninspired. The entire game is essentially based on one lackluster thing: Regis Philbin repeating the same phrases over and over again. "Be Sure to come back to... Who Wants to be a Millionaire." "I hope you'll join me again on... Who Wants to be a Millionaire." If one doesn't decide to resell (or simply trash) this game within its first week of purchase, they work for Disney Interactive or are Regis themselves. Don't waste your time on this pitiful effort
+ I rented Contact from GameFly, and played it for a few days before deciding that I am going to purchase it in the not-too-distant future. Unfortunately, GameFly does not rent games along with instruction manuals, so I had to learn everything in game by trial and error. Even so, I was doing pretty well if I do say so myself, and had to stop myself from playing anymore so I wouldn't waste the purchase later. :) It reminded me of other RPG-type games I've played in the past, such as NES' original Zelda. If you liked Zelda, you'll probably like this game. But buy it, or borrow from a friend who'll loan you the manual too! To have that help may make all the difference! :)
- Driving physics are as unrealistic as they can get.  Obtaining licenses is extremely difficult, made worse by poor car physics.  Your heavy car easily bounces off light cars, while light cars easily derail your heavy car.  Turning the steering wheel only slightly produces heavy tire squeal, and that's with sports tires!Long gone are the ESPN-like replays of GT 2.  For some reason cars look thinner than before.  The analog tachometer has been reduced to just a bar across the screen.  The 3D mechanics can be headache prone, made worse by the poor physics of the cars.  Easily the most inadequate music ever.The game makes you start with a used model of only certain makes, which is nothing new.  However, it takes a long time to earn any money for a better car.  Only 7 horsepower upgrades make huge differences on the track?!  The game has mostly only newer models, almost none from a few years ago, unlike in GT 2.The only good thing about this game is that you don't have to drive all the time.  The B-Spec driving mode can win races for you.  Just leave for a few minutes and return to a victory screen.  This can help in skipping the painful, early parts of the game.The powertrain is still not modifiable.  Compression, bore, stroke, camshaft timing/overlap, valve size, and other engine characteristics are still not available.  With poor driving physics, engine modification would not have helped this game.Loading times are very long, with the most annoying loading indicator ever.  Constant auto saving feature is quick but can become annoying.  There is an excessive amount of confirmation screens.This game is a yet another disappointment, much like GT 3 was.  The makers of this game made it quite clear that if you want to know what the real cars drive like, you will have to drive them for real.  The Gran Tourismo series are over, unlikely to return to what they used to be.  I'm not a racing game fan, but only GT 2 was good enough for me to buy.  If you want good, car make-independent physics, you need to play Gran Tourismo 2.
- Don't buy this - it will crash your entire xbox.  Learn to play - forget the cheats
+ This looked to be the new circuit board with flash ram and new modification options for the enthusiast. The package was certainly new, but the circuit board was the original version 1.You'll need to go to great lengths to make sure you're getting a version 2, if it's possible at all. Good luck
- If you are looking for codes like Game Shark had, this is not for you.  Not only do you HAVE to have a computer, If anything happens to the disk, you are screwed.  You won't be able reinstall windows, or install it on a new computer.  Some games do offer rewards like unlimited health for %100 completion.  So if those are they games you plan on using,  this is the best thing out there
+ Brings back the good old days of playing these games after school
+ One of the most common complaints is that Xenosaga Ep. It's battle system is annoying and ponderous because "even in 'regular' battles, it forces you to spend many turns Stocking just so that you can do decent damage to enemies." This is actually a form of codespeak. What these people are really saying is "I'm not very bright, and even after several hours of playing Ep. II, I somehow never realized how to use the battle system efficiently." Ep. II puts a great deal of emphasis on each character's attack attributes. Attacks are classified as either Physical or Ether, and then there are elementals (fire, ice, lighting, aura) and finally there are types (slash/pierce/hit). Sound complicated? Eh, a little more so than the average RPG. Not nearly as bad as something like Vagrant Story. All you have to do is use Analyze on any enemy you're unfamiliar with to see their weaknesses, and then use the Change command to bring in the character that has the proper attack. When you come across enemies with Physical/elemental weaknesses, there are Ethers which you can cast to add that element to a character's physical attack. If their weakness is ether/elemental, then just use the standard elemental spell Ethers against them. This is all you need to do to make battles flow at nice, normal pace.For some reason, the vast majority of Ep. II players seemed to never realize this. Instead, they saw their only option to be using the Stock command for nine (NINE!) turns in a row before beginning their attack. Even on wimpy garden variety wandering monsters! They took no heed of enemy weaknesses, using characters with physical/fire based attacks against enemies weak vs. ether/ice. RPG players used to have a reputation for being the more intelligent gamers. I wonder what happened... A lot of Ep. I fans never bothered to play Ep. II because negative word of mouth spread so quickly amongst the fanbase as soon as the JP version was released. But now that Ep. III is out (and it's truly fantastic) a lot of them will finally play Ep. II soon. I hope they do better than the first rounders did
- returned item for refund; found it cheaper at Toys R U
+ THIS PREVIEW HAS SPOILERS OF THE GAME PLEASE DON T READ IT IF YOU DIDN'T T PLAY IT!I played Xenogears and when I saw Xenosaga Episode was kinda short compare xenogears in battle system but was ok because xenosaga was like an "introduction".OK improvements:Gameplay was Longer than Episode 1 (I ended Episode 1 with everything in 42 hours) in change Ep2 (88+).Sidequest is like a plus if you want it to do it if you don t you can end the game anyways.The Idea of Epiloge after you finish the game was very cool because you could kill special bosses and get better and kill the final boss overkilled and stuff like that.Chaos Jr Momo Shion and Kosmos Looking was improved they looked more grow up.Battle system to put them up or down depending who you were using or fighting as well double Tech attacksAll Characters were able to use all magic skills as long you buy them with your skillpoints and making able with the sidequests.Momo Bow was a very nice improvement and now she can be a very good Damage DealerRecover Mp while stock was a good idea as well to use ep freely without any trouble.People complain because history was focus in Jr and URTVs but the title says itself means "Beyond Good and Evil" wich means "Rubedo worring for the ladies in danger and his Red Dragon mode wich makes him go out of control (possible reason of Sakura Death), Albedo and his obssesive love for rubedo but at the same time to kill him as well, Nigredo wich refused to do a mission (involved with Rubedo) and killed his own father but he plays as good person at the moment as albedo said "Giving life from 1 hand and delivering death from the other".Honestly second episode history role was more development than first one because wasn't t an introduction and we were starting to know how things were going...What they did wrong:I don t see how they could think throw away the tech attacks was going to be a good idea...Good Thing they added the tech attacks and special attacks in ep 3 You had to do stock a lot of times to make a good combo between characters(wich made battles kinda boring)Music in battle was kinda boring compare to Ep 1Voices of Chaos(sounded boring...) Kos-Mos (like Fake silly girl trying to play as a robot) Shion (Pushing and like "I m better than you") Momo (Very Annoying) sad thing is my main team is Chaos Kosmos and Momo that's why I got sad for that voice changes but they said they refix their voices as episode 1 in the third and last episode.Ep 1 has almost 8 hours of movies Ep 2 4:30hours (I guess for the complains of the long movies)I still don t get it movies give more motion of the storyrole of the game wich is most of the attractive things Xenosaga has over most of the games. In Episode 3 is 4hours of full motion movies but plus the speak texts with faces included while characters move and do stuff like Valkyrie ProfileThey cut completely the close up when they cast spells or hit lights and stuff most of the time you see characters back all the way while you are fighting. (they fix that in ep3)In Resume as everyone know Episode 2 had bad things but as well good things (as every game) no they shouldn't t did it bad when they noticed the things people like of the game itself. Good thing is they fixed most of the bad stuff of Episode 2 to Episode 3. Battle system soundtrack and characters voices all is better only thing I didn't t like of episode 3 battle mode is they make it appear as an average rpg system (attack, ether, tech, special tech, and others) so forget the 4 combinations to make a tech attacks and ethers cost "ep(cp)" special attacks cost boosts. I wonder if attack will give some "ep(cp)" later. Even with all this I recommend you to buy it before you get episode 3 because you will be losing a lot of storyline if you don t and more now they cost 20 dollars each (or less)Atte:Roy_Master
- SMALL MEMORY WHICH MEANS THAT U CAN ONLY PUT 1 SAVE ON IT SO U HAVE TO RUN BACK TO YOUR COMP EVERYTIME U WANNA SAVE!!! AND SOFTWARE IS VERY CONFUSING!!! HORRIBLE BUY!!! I RETURNED THE PIECE OF JUNK!!
- I am extremity disappointed with this game.  Every section and mission is exactly the same with the exception of the location.  There is absolutely no skill involved in beating the game which I was able to do in 3 sittings. 
+ While I think some of the reviews of Xenosaga II are a little harsh, they have hit on a few good points. In terms of plot, the first thing that really let me down was KOS-MOS. Don't let her face covering the cover of the game fool you. While being one of the main characters in the first game, she hardly does ANYTHING in this game until the end, which seems less like a plot point and more of the creators obliging her. The same can be said for Shion as well. This shift from center stage hurts these characters, and it's really disappointing. Instead, Jr. takes center stage. Instead of shedding light on events in the first game, it opens up a whole knew set of issues that really don't get resolved. If you're looking for the story pull that the first game had, it'll be hard to find in this game.  Jr. is a character that I personally don't care much about, but if you are a fan of him, then you'll enjoy this game, as you learn a lot about his past as a U.R.T.V.A new character that is introduced is Shion's brother, Jin Uzuki. Personally, I liked Jin, but you don't get to use him much in the game. With him, Shion, Jr. and Albedo, there is an underlying theme of "brothers" or "siblings" in the story, although don't look for much elaboration on Jin and Shion. Although some people aren't pleased with the battle system in this game, I actually enjoyed it. I caught into it quicker than the first game's system. You can also acquire a skill that points out the enemies' weak zones, which I found very useful. I also liked being able to build up attacks, and then boost to really slam the enemy. Overall, it's a game I really enjoyed. The game has some replay value to it, and there are certain things that you actually can't accomplish UNTIL you've beaten the game once. At times, re-watching certain scenes over and over again gets boring. Yet I would recommend this series, as if nothing else, it serves as a bridge between the first game and the upcoming third game.
- Really? Wow. So, players in real football go through other players torso's? They skate and glide around the field at 40MPH without moving their legs? WR's change direction on one foot, pivot, glide and elude tackles? Uh, ok.Anyone who plays this game on the All-madden level will notice right away that this is the furthest thing from a realistic football game.What are the nerds at EA thinking? Do they ENJOY making a game who's AI constantly cheats? I love how they tout games that "give the user more control" when the user has very LITTLE CONTROL over anything that goes on in the game. I don't control if I catch it or drop it, or intercept it, or if my line blocks, of if my DB's cover their assignment...none of it. The COMPUTER makes my line miss blocks or not block at all...drop easy picks...drop easy catches, etc. And why, oh why, are DT's and LB's faster than my fastest WR? Is THAT realistic? The AI is terrible. It blatantly and UNrealistically cheats.Terrible game. Just stop making these games if this is your final product
- This game is a joke. It is the same exact game as the 2005 version with minimal additions. The online play is so glitchy and drops so often its not even worth the time. Do not go out and buy this game thinking that its better because of all the hype. If you want to play a great football game go get NFL 2K5 by 2KSports/Sega Sports. This game is 3 years old and blows Madden away any day of the week. In 2k5 you are able to go to roster manager and change your rosters to make them current. You can edit players and create rookies like Reggie Bush or Jerious Norwood and make the roster the same as the current 2007 NFL lineups. Madden bought the rights to be the only official Nfl game for the sole reason that Madden sucks and he wants to make all the money and not spend any money improving his game. Madden bought the rights to the Nfl trademak through 2010 so no other companies could make an official Nfl game and thats why there is no 2k7 or any other game football game for it to compete with. Thats why Blitz is the only other game and they cannot use Nfl players so they have to have a generic game without real players. I hate Madden with a passion. 2K Sports is the way to go for any sports game including football you just have to do some manual labor updating rosters but once you have it is current and still 10x better than Madden will ever be. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- I swear if it wasn't that I liked final fantasy 7 and 8 so much I'd just break this game at then I'd move on and be happy. But I can't do that because that would be waste of money the only thing that kept me in the game was the fact that I didn't want to waste money. This game makes kingdom hearts look like a M rated game. Oh my god this is so childish. You know how in most final fantasy games they try to make the main character cool they didn't feel like doing that in this one. You are a monkey-man! How stupid is that. Plus the other character are way more dumb looking that the main one mi just happy I beat in and can put that awful exp. behind me. AHHHHHHHHHH
- I have been an extremely devoted SMB fan since the very first time I laid eyes on it. I own ALL of them, and so when I stood in line all night Saturday (and through Sunday morning, 8am), I made sure to grab myself a copy of SMB: Banana Blitz for my brand new Wii. I bought an entire set of controllers, anticipating the mini-game fun with all my friends. (We're huge SMB fans, all of us. It always makes an appearance at our parties.)But now I'm really angry. They completely gutted our favourite mini-game(s), hitting Monkey Target worst of all. I can honestly say I don't care that there are 50 freaking mini-games, because now Monkey Target is completely worthless. Instead of the amazingly subtle game play with bonus items, increasingly difficult levels, magnets, velcro, double bonuses, wind speed and direction, and the all-import ramp run-off you have... a cannon, one level, no wind or wind direction, no bonuses, and no special items.Who cares if I can SORT of pilot a submarine on a single level? Monkey squash -- no joy there. A lot of the controls for the mini-games are terrible. And so on, so forth. The new mini games suck almost unilaterally, but gosh darn, there are 50 of them! But volume does not make up for lack of quality.I love traditional SMB levels and the ones on SMB: Banana Blitz are nice. The graphics are beautiful and fun. But the best part of the game for me and my friends, is now gone and dead. None of the reviews I'd read mentioned the fact that this favourite of most SMB players was killed like this, and if they had, I certainly wouldn't have wasted my $50 plus tax.If Sega people are reading this: BRING BACK MONKEY TARGET. That's what people play at parties when they're slightly drunk and sick of listening to Super Smash Brothers, and way too awake to enjoy Mario Party
+ This is THE GAME for race lovers, awesome graphics, car response is just like the real thing, photo lab is very nice too (you can take pics of your rides) you will never get bored of this game. A must have
+ Really it is a good game on war, buy it since it is very good
+ Used this product to soft mod my xbox. Had to download an older version of the software though. If you just use it to cheat in games..probably not worth the money.
+ Can you use the Action Replay on your Xbox for multi-player games, like on halo2 can u use codes their and make it so you get unlimited ammo,  because that is the only reason why I want to use this product is so that I can have unlimited ammo and not have to reload. I would want invisibility  but then it would be obvious that I was cheating, and when u read that u probablly thought, well its gonna look like ur cheating when ur guy doesnt have to reload and doesnt run out of ammo. but still I would like to know this before I buy it. I will probably end up buying it anyways to see wut this pup can do
-   As was said in a earlier review the creators of final fantasy are giving us everything but what we actually asked for.  They gave us Advent Children, cell phone games, and finally Dirge of Cerberus.  This game is an action based game showing you a day in the life of the most under-used and least interesting character in the Final Fantasy Series.  Its the creators way of telling us that they will never re-make Final Fantasy VII but will rather insult us with every marketing ploy know to man
+ Yes, I am a die-hard Star Wars fan and yes, I love a good mission-based action game so man, if this isn't the perfect game for me! It's so much fun and there's so much freedom in the game in itself! Add on to that the space missions and Wow, this game totally blows me away! Highly recommended for anyone who is a Star Wars fan, a FPS fan, or a fan of fun game-play
+ I've had this game since it first came out and I am still not sick of it.  I think anyone that enjoys the Halo multiplayer would enjoy this game. Lucasarts improved just about everything you can think of from the first Battlefront.  The story mode and galactic conquest (strategy mode) are excellent additions to the basic Battlefront where you simply take over bases and kill the enemy (but thank goodness they still kept that in this game). I do miss some of the old scenarios, but a lot of the new scenarios are really good and the new controls make Battlefront II totally worth playing. I love the improved controls, new characters, and the new space battles.  The ability to sprint is an ingenious addition.  In most games you can walk, or run.  In this game the characters have the ability to run very fast by sprinting.  They can also kneel, lay, dive, and roll. I hope all future action games adopt this.  I do wish the characters had the ability to punch someone, after all they can do just about everything else. The ability to change your character at bases you control is a nice addition.  Engineers with the ability to repair things or take over occupied enemy vehicles is great.  There is a nice array of weapons and the ability to play as specialized characters such as Darth Vader or Boba Fett is awesome.  The space battles are really fun, except when you board the enemy ship there is only limited areas that you have access to. The graphics are great in HD. Pros:Controlsability to sprintchange characters at basesengineers that repair things and steal enemy vehiclesgraphicsmultiple scenariosa lot of charactersplay as specialty characters (jedi)space battlesmultiple playing options (strategy mode, story mode, and basic Battlefront mode)Cons:characters don't have the ability to punch someone boarding an enemy ship in a space battle has very limited access to the enemy ship Some of the fun scenarios from the first Battlefront are not in this one The option of flying multiple ships, playing multiple characters, using turrets in both space battles and regular battles, and all of the multiple things your characters can do make this game worth playing
+ I have been playing the madden series since I was a kid and this game is really good. the games  just keep getting better and better as each year passes. everything in this game is worth the money I strongly recommend it
+ I have to start off by saying if you own the 06 version, then don't bother updating, as you may not notice many of the updates/upgrades.Is this an awesome game? Yes, but it has a few holes even still; 1) Too much sacking on your QB by the CPU. 2)The CPU will run the ball so darn often, it is a joke. 3)The game might strain your PS2 as it loads so often,4)If you want to play on all-madden level, you are FORCED to play with QB vision on, which we all know stinks!Basically, they have tossed in a few more options so you can play as a blocker or etc on offense and you have more advanced defensive controls such as match-ups, assignments, etc. Also, the franchise mode is still really great and the superstar mode is quite enjoyable as well.What about this game is really good? Well, it is safe to say the graphics are quite good and the commentary is solid once again. The crispness of the passing is great and the running game is a big part of this years focus. It is still really fun to have a running QB with a strong arm, it is an easy way to dominate the game! BTW, the new kicking scheme is actually really easy after test it out a time or two, now I am making 90% FG's easily! You can fully tinker with the AI and change all other settings as well.The rosters are also accurate but personally, if you own madden 06, wait 4-6 more weeks and then buy this one for $19 as a PS2 best of game
- All of the people that gave this game a review of more than two stars are bs-ing you.  Those people are probably hardcore ff7 fans - that game was barely mediocre at best.  Other ff7 releases = advent children, cell phone game, and movie/tv show thing.  All three things, respectively, sucked.  Now comes, "Dierge of Cerberus"  whoop did eeee doo!!  The only reason why I rented it was because the title says, "final fantasy" in it.  The only redeeming quality of this game is the cutscenes - other than that, boring.  If you can get more than 20 minutes through the game, then by all means, it's the game for you
+ it is a pretty fun game with a few quirks here and there. Some of them include the annoying "click button" interface, and a few problems that are just a random guess to solve. Other than that, it has very good graphics and a very addictive story line
- I really wanted to like this game.. unfortunately for me, it blows. I'd trade it for a migraine if I could. The game-play is pretty horrible, the sword scenes are reminiscent of PC adventure games circa 1992, where you press the "Attack" key and  swing your sword aimlessly at the bad-guy. The runandgun part of the game is nothing to write home about either. It feels like being teleported into the body of a cracked-out, 1 legged, drunken monkey. Also, I know the graphics aren't the Wii's strong-point, but that is no excuse to regress back to 8-bit. When you're trying to shoot someone across the room, it really sucks when you can't tell them  apart from a flower pot.....or is that a lawn chair?The cut scene's were obviously supposed to look like Sin City. I stress the word SUPPOSED cause they were probably strung together by some poor intern after the development team went into hiding. They look like an amateur flash slide-show. Kinda like what your local momandpop video editor would have put together if your little nephew had gotten his way and had a Sin City themed Bar Mitzvah.This game is a joke. Anybody associated with it should be embarrassed.
- I can't stand this game after 5 minutes. The game is so unresponsive its not funny.  The first board I wanted to throw my remote. My friend watching asked me what the hell was going on. I seriously didn't move the remote at all and my guy starts spinning around. At first I thought maybe the control calibration is wrong but then I was playing trauma center before and after Red steel and not once did I have a problem with the controls. Seriously the worst game I ever played
- This is a perfect example of false advertisement. If you're like the many that I've heard of trying to order a remote for the PlayStation 2, Don't order this one unless you have a newer model. The picture shows an IR unit but it doesn't come with one. So save yourself the hassle and don't order this
+ This game is a great one. I enjoyed this game it is one of my favorites. I recommend this game for anyone who enjoys Final Fantasy or a good RPG
+ This is perhaps the best of the Final Fantasy games, and sadly, the most under-appreciated. IX had amazing animation and backgrounds, a beautiful music score, and solid game-play. The characters are some of the most delightful in the series. Personally, I think Vivi and Zidane are the coolest characters ever. Lastly, the  gorgeous cut scenes deliver a beautiful and epic story line. On a side note, This game definitely deserves a remake. There's a lot of hype about final fantasy VII, its own prequel and a remake coming for PS3. I feel that Final Fantasy IX should be remade on the PS3. I love the story line better than VII, the graphics were way better, and the game-play was incredible
- I saw a DVD player at Target for $30 yesterday.  I especially don't see the need for the xbox 360 remote if it's $40!!  Space-saving, maybe???
- A simple DVD player, as long as you or a friend own an X-box console. Simply push in a little plastic knob into the controller socket and their you go you know own a standard of the line DVD player.The magnification is great the rewind and fast forward is great.It has all the extras a normal DVD player has and a easy to operate menu and layout.No overloads of pointless buttons just point out the obvious structure.You may be disappointed in the response time, but that is not entirely the remote or players fault.If you own an old x-box console or a low memory X-box console  you may encounter slowness and maxed out freezing.Some mint condition titles may not even work.(I purchased "Little Nicky" sometime ago mint and to this date it still does not work on my X-box console)Batteries may play a roll.With out a doubt though this is the most easy and portable DVD player around with the acknowledgement of owning an X-box console first.A must have for a gamer/movie lover wit ha large movie library or a constant renter
- "Hey kids, fire up the XBOX and lets watch this movie!" That is what is heard through households that own an XBOX but for some reason or another they are still in the 90's and don't already have a DVD player. Like my title suggests, if you already have a DVD player, this is a waste of money. The only reason I purchased one is because my DVD player had problems playing some DVD-R's that I got from a friend. I had some money to burn so I just wanted to see if the XBOX DVD kit could play it to determine if the DVD was a bad burn or was it just my DVD player. I found that the XBOX was able to play the DVD-R's in question with no problem. However, aside from those two DVD-R's, all of the DVD's I own are bought from retail stores, so I really have no need to play DVD-R's, and my DVD player plays normal discs perfectly. With that being said, I only used XBOX's DVD playback kit once to watch the DVD-R's I had problems with. Because of the content of these burned "movies", there is really no need to watch them again....... However if push comes to shove I can always use one of my PC's or Mac to watch the burned DVD; no need to use my XBOX for that. I meant to return the DVD kit the next day, but never got around to it. The XBOX's DVD player is a good feature, but the fact that Microsoft charges you to use the feature makes it not worth the money.....unless of course you don't have a DVD player at all.
+ Quick delivery - Product arrived on time and in excellent condition.   You have quality shipping.  Thank yo
- My only experience with this product was after I opened it, and started to play a DVD in my Xbox, when I tried to pause it, it didn't work, and it had brand new batteries. I found (after much frustration) that if I smacked it against my hand a few times then it would work for about 2 minutes. I took it back to exchange for another in hopes that it was just a bad unit, but it was sold out so I just got my money back. You can buy a DVD player for not much more than this way overpriced piece of junk costs
+ I love this game because it is about a beautiful little Prince's and a boy with a tail who loves the princesses I have played this game over and over and still play it more.I don't think I will ever get tired of it. it is so much fun.
+ We've all heard of Final Fantasy 8 and Final Fantasy 10, but does anyone ever mention the game in between? Final Fantasy 9 is, sadly, the most underestimated game in the Final Fantasy series. It's the one that pulled me into my FF condom, and though it's around 6 years old I still love it. The reason it's not as famous as the others is probably because FF9 came out on the PlayStation JUST before the PlayStation 2 came out. The story line is spellbinding--It captures you right at the beginning and flows beautifully, through cities of eternal rain, clashing monsters, and the (Traditional plot theme in almost every RPG alive!) fate of the world itself. Everyone can relate to FF9's characters, who struggle to find who they are or where they belong and in the end, find, or almost find, the meaning in a stunning finale. Then you'll find yourself cheering for them (or mourning over them if you become attached to one who dies.)The music? Nob, you've outdone yourself. FF9's songs are masterpieces, and you'll find yourself humming YOU'RE NOT ALONE or MELODIES OF LIFE without knowing it. And of course, a couple pieces will bring back amusing scenes just by mentioning their name. (SLEW OF LOVE LETTERS, anyone?)Any cons? Hard question. If there were a problem, then I can't target it. Perhaps leveling up your character may take a while, but then again that's a traditional part of every FF Game so it shouldn't be counted. And being able to play as a few of the "legendary" characters(Irately, Beatrix) would be great, but that would take away their status, wouldn't it? (And that's an opinion, so I'll let it slide.) I can think about this until my head explodes, but I won't be able to target an ACTUAL flaw. I, Lariat, find Final Fantasy 9 the perfect RPG game.Overall, and again, this has got to be the greatest FF game out there. I've played most of the others popular in the series now, but they just don't strike me like FF9. Wait. What are you listening to ME for? GET FF9 AND PLAY IT. Once you do, my review will look  like it's degrading this game
- DO NOT USE THIS the DVD thing causes  the xbox to break. when u play games the disk doesn't constantly spin. it reads some and takes break so it doesn't over heat. when it reads a DVD, it must constantly spin. the DVD playback kit frayed my xbox. at most "best buy"s you can buy a footplate that functions better for less money than the one for xbox.
- this just sucks the main person just keeps running around.He just keeps running and or walking which is controlled through the key board.no fwd bike control,he won't peddle, but gos backwards quite well.Tryed different setups reloads and nothing worked.Atleast I bought it used and for not much money.Maybe ill find a fix and try it again later
+ It was a great game that can include your whole family or entertain people at a party.Sometimes when you have a lot of people over you can even have a dance party.Overall its a great game and I recommend you buy it.
- I'm going to start this review by saying that I came to the Wii as a lifetime PC-only gamer. I have never felt the need to buy a console until the Wii and its fun controller system came out. The aspect I was most excited about was controlling first person shooters just as precisely and intuitively as the mouse and keyboard, together with the added entertainment of using it for other motion-activated actions within the game (rowing, throwing grenades, close combat, etc). As a result, after spending the night out in the cold to get my console, and flushed with excitement at seeing all the merchandise, I grabbed three games: Zelda (a no-brainer), Trauma Center, and Call of Duty 3. Of those three titles, I'm sorry to say that CoD 3 was the one to leave a bitter taste in my mouth.  As I have stated before, I am a PC gamer; I'm really into my hobby, and love the satisfaction of building a PC which can manage all the latest games. I played CoD 1 and 2 on the PC, and greatly enjoyed both. By far the biggest problem with the Wii version, however, especially as someone accustomed to playing on the computer, are the graphical shortcomings of the title. I literally had no idea what was going on. I could barely tell which direction the enemies were coming from and the only reason why I was going in the right direction was because of the linear construction of most of the levels. Added to this, I had no idea how to get rid of the first German to engage me in hand to hand combat (a much advertised feature, which is actually just an interactive cut-scene). I followed the instructions to wave my controllers around wildly, and although I worked myself into a frenzy (causing my dogs to panic and think something really was attacking me) that inevitable German (I tried throwing all my grenades into the room he hides in) kept clubbing me to death. Even beyond this setback, I found that the controls were often quite poorly implemented. It is also disappointing (yet speaks volumes) that the grenade 'throwing' function that involves you actually 'throwing' the nunchuck (without letting go, by the way, unless you've got a backup TV) is disabled by default; trying to use it usually gets you to miss your target/get cut down/ blow yourself up. For the record, I know that the Wii controller works. I've played many hours of other games already (as the system conveniently informs you). This just seems like a shoddy implementation of it.I can definitely tell you that there is a lot of ambition here to convey the frenzy of war, with some obvious strong attempts at creating absorbing combat scenes. Nevertheless, it essentially boils down to being a messy soup of blurry pixels which, even to my game-play-over-graphics mentality in buying the Wii, blocks the enjoyability of this title. To be honest, it has made me think that WW2 isn't the best-suited area for the Wii. After all, these historical titles tend to rely a great deal on cinematically portraying the visceral splendor of war, rather then pushing exciting new game-play elements. My advice on the FPS front: wait for the Wii 'Far Cry' game and see how that turns out. In the meantime, there are countless hours of other great titles more suited to the Wii graphics waiting for your attention. Before leaving you, I'd just like to clarify on thing: this is the perspective of someone who has very little experience with consoles. Perhaps you're reaction to the game will be very different if you come to the Wii straight from a gamecube instead of PC/high definition gaming.Oh, and if you're still determined to buy it, keep an eye out for my used copy of the game; I'm going to need the money for 'Banana Blitz'..
- I haven't even got to play it yet because the game does not work on my PS2. After the PS2 logo comes up, the screen goes blank and nothing happens. I thought it was maybe just that disc, but I exchanged it and the same thing happened. I called Ubisoft and they said many people with the Slim PS2 have called to say it doesn't work, but they don't have any answers. Sony said that it is an error in the format of the discs, and it may not work in many PS2's. Do not buy if you don't want the risk of it not working!!!!
+ If you already have an Eye Toy and your favourite game on it is Beat Freak, then you have to get Eye Toy Groove.  The 28 tracks on it cover 40 years of great dance music, from Elvis to Good Charlotte.  As a 46 year old woman, I got this as an alternative of boring, repetitive workout tapes, with great success - the game even has a calorie counter built in.   This is also a fun game for me to play with my three kids, ages from 8 to 16.   Even the preschoolers I occasionally babysit enjoy the special effects in the chill out room, and the lyrics in all the songs are suitable for family listening, which is more than I can say for Dance Dance Revolution
- As one that couldn't stand NBA Ballers, I thought I would give this game a try.Pros: create a ballerNice graphicsCons: Defense? If you are a fan of Pheonix Sun basketball, you will love this game The announcer needs to learn ENGLISHThe whole "I-Ball Trick Stick" is horrible and will have you sreaming as you're stuck on the second side game that is required before you can advance on And 1 tourThat stupid mic trick that allows you to score 4 points with one shotStupid Watch This Trick that you can't stop despite the fact that you can still move your player. You can't even block!You can not choose who you want to face in other game modes unless you are playing two player. Guess which game I'll be trading for NBA Live 2007 or WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2007 this fall? 
-  Ok let me break itdown for you. The Game isn't all thatb great, infact it sucks on ice, but the only reason I am giving this game fear grade is because of the year. Really you really can't blame them that made this game. The Fact Is 2006 is one of the worst years. there just throwing all the game at your face and they arent really that great. we see about 90% of games and movies arent doing that good. so my suchest is wait to 2007 when the PS3 and the wii comes out. I Promise you that year want disoponte. So don't buy every thing in 06, wait till 07. Dont waiste your mone
- why is it that 3rd party memory cards can store at least double the information that these can? These memory cards are way over priced. I love PS2. It's one of the best systems I have ever played and owned, but this memory card stuff is a scam. I already own 2 cards and I need more.
- This is without a doubt the worste game I have ever purchased. It is basiclly one big empty landscape with about 16 or so bosses that you have to climb on to beat.They could have made this a decent game so easily just by puting in some minions and some characters to talk to and buy stuff from. As it is right now it's just a really, really, really, crappy version of Zelda: Orcarina of Time.If you have any respect for decent video games you will not buy this video game unless it is for the sole purpose of setting it on fire and stomping on it
- I gave it one star because there was no way to give it less.This game when played on the X Box was great.  So when it came out for PC I bought it.  BIG MISTAKE!  The control are too hard to learn.  And when you are in a battle you can't stop to think which keys when used together work. There are too many keys that you need to push together to do even the simplest thing.   I wasted my money on this game.  I deleted it and will never play it.  Don't waste your money
- I ordered this from amazon, it shipped from 3btech.... and ive had no luck with it... the communicator its self is quite comfortable... but I cannot comment on the quality of the mic or the audio that comes through it because it will not charge... I called logitech tech support and the tech asked me the usual questions (is it plugged in, have you tried a different wall outlet, have you tried jiggling the plug at the communicator end, and so on) after all the questions the tech said that it was defective and that they were running dangerously low on stock of that particular one.   So I guess what mi trying to say is order at ur own risk and I hope you have better luck with it than I did
- ok first of all let me say that yes this mic has a nice look and feel to it..also being wireless it adds to its attractivness but over all this mic after a long time of wearing it can really hurt your ear....it becomes very uncomfortable to wear and has even given me headaches, being as how me and a friend needed a headset we both bought one...I no longer use this headset while my freind has no choice till he gets his 360 also, and to this day he constantly has to say "hold up mi switching my mic to my other ear cause this ear is starting to hurt" with the 360 controller and headset being wireless and it becoming more availible just wait cause in the end this headset isnt worth the price and it wont be compatible for your 360
+ That might be a little misleading -- the battle mechanics are almost exactly the same as those in the first game (heck, as in most of Nippon Ichi's games, though this series, I think, is the best of the lot).  That part of the game absolutely delivers:- Great classes.- Good monsters, and a more consistent class sytem for them.- Excellent assortment of items.- Good variety of levels.However, as far as the story -- an area in which Hour of Darkness was solid -- this game falls on its face.  The writing is iffy, the plot itself is contrived, the characters (while certainly amusing) are predictable, and it just leaves so much to be desired.  If you're looking for a storyline you can get involved in, go back to the first game.If you're in it for the game-play, though, don't miss this one!  With some class tweaks and a few added features, Cursed Memories is a worthy addition for those who simply want the monotonous level-up madness that some of us thrive on.Great 2D art mixed with fun environments, HILARIOUS quips and item descriptions, engaging fights and hundreds of hours (literally) of entertainment
- Have you played any of the games in the Doom series?  How about Metroid Prime? Medal of Honor? Golden Eye?  Well, then you've played Halo 2, also, because ALL First Person Shooter games are exactly the same.  I don't care how many times X-Box magazine (odd how the magazine that drools the most over an X-BOX game is the system's magazine.) calls it the greatest game of all time, I'd rather play Mario Power Tennis which was atrocious.The story is absolutely appauling in terms of a Science Fiction orientated theme, utterly mundane, unoriginal, boring and just all around unentertaining.  The game-play is so generic that it's as if this was the first creation of some fresh out of college video game designer, the music is cliche, the voice acting is flat, and Master Chief is just an all around retard.The weapons, oh boy, the weapons, again another lame aspect of the game.  The alien's weapons are like something in the kid's "toy gun" section from Toys R Us, and the human guns are nothing that I haven't used in a Resident Evil game.When the first Halo came out I didn't get the big deal, I didn't even play it, then eventually I got myself an X-Box, and decided to give this installment a shot - huge mistake.  Come to think of it none of the games of X-box are even worth owning a system for: Fable was decent, but got old after beating it a few times, The Knights of the Old Republic series was boring, and everything else on X-Box I could play on PS2 or Gamecube
- Halo 1 on steroids, Halo 2 is a clear Microsoft stamp on Bungie's creativity and control and it muddies up what was a balanced game-play.  A hackneyed single player story that makes no sense, and has no flow, along with levels that aren't replayable.  You thought the Library from Halo1 was tedious?  Try the headache inducing map design in this game.  Also in the nonsense, the unneccesary switch to an Elite's perspective for half the game, along with a new group of Covenant bad guys that look like rejects from a Captain Planet cartoon.  Apes with mohawks, yeah, nice design.  I can only play one or two levels of the single player, and they are so noobish, it loses appeal quickly. On to Multiplayer.  Okay, in 2004 upon release, this was a great game.  It took time to go up in level, and the ranking system wasn't as abused as it is now.  Once new maps, kept on the harddrive (read mod kids) were released by Bungie, that opened the door to full blown chaos.  Now 2 years later, modding has died down somewhat, but a whole new slew of bridging and connection speed manipulation makes it roughly 25% likely you'll find a game with no lag.  So I still play on occasion, it's lame they can't offer dedicated servers so you can play your map of choice, choose servers with good connections, and then the modders and big gun noobs can find the type of game they want to play too.  I only pray Halo 3's multiplayer improves on this system, otherwise I'm done with the Xbox console permanently
- Before I was even done with Final Fantasy VII, I ordered this game. I loved that game, and thought 'Say, if Final Fantasy VII is this good, then VIII must be even better!', boy was I wrong! I'm not bashing Final Fantasy VIII, I kind of liked the game, but there are big problems with it. First of all, the draw system is kind of hard, but I liked it, it was a change of pace, but the way you have to equip summon GFs (Guardian Force) was hard and boring. The music in the game reminds me of the music in the movie 'AKIRA', which is a bad thing, The characters in battle remind me of crash dummies, and the way that you get new weapons is by making them at junk shops! Not only that, but the characters are not very likeable.Main characters:Squall- A member of SeeD, he is a jerk to everybody.Zell-A member of SeeD, he is a surfer dude and a dunce.Quistis-A teacher and a member of SeeD, she seems to like Squall...for one reason or another...Seifer- Squall's rival, he is even worse then Squall.Rinoa- A member of 'The owls',Square soft ran out of ideas, she is just like Aeris.Selphie- A member of SeeD, she is a weird character and I was sad to see her in Kingdom hearts.Laguna- A Galbadian soldier. He is the best charecter in the game.Irvine-A member of SeeD, he is a lady's man and is recycled later in Final Fantasy IX as a better charecter known as Zidane.This game is the second worst Final Fantasy game ever made. The story is great, but playing it is so bad that its almost unbelivable. If Square soft remade this game for the PS2 or PSP, I would buy it, but only if they removed the draw system
+ If you liked the first Disgaea you will just love the second one!  The game builds upon all the strong points of the previous game.  Now instead of taking FOREVER to get powerful characters you can achieve characters like the archer, ninja, etc. much quicker.  The main characters are still hilarious, and I love the fact that you get to see Laharl, Etna and the gang again in this one.  (Go Prism Rangers =/).Once again the plot isn't too twisted, but it is enjoyable. Back to the game play though, its similar to the old one, but you have more options.  For one, you can JOIN the Dark Assembly.  In the item world you can not only level your item, but go to an assembly, improve the luck of your item, and purchase items such as alcohol and bombs to influence  the assembly.  There is also the new addition of the subpoena.  These are felony charges that your characters receive based upon too many murders, too much hp etc. etc.  These are "medals of honor" in the demon world, and allow your characters more prestige, not to mention they once again make you want to go to the item world. Another bonus, you can transfer the bailiff for your subpoena onto your item, so you can get a felony charge, and level your item at the same time.This game is a fabulous addition to any gamer's collection, and I highly recommend it!  Enjoy
+ I am going to write this review mostly for those familiar with the original Disgaea. As such I will not get to much into the aspect of game-play and the system of the game aside from things that have changed or are important to note. Having said that, let's begin.The game begins in the land of Veldime, an alternate world from that of the first game, where an evil Overlord named Zenon has hidden from well, everyone. When he came into Veldime however, he placed a curse on the land that changed all humans into demons. The effects weren't all immediate as some still have several human qualities but if the curse is not reversed soon, there will be no turning back. Thus the hero Adell (oddly enough the only person unaffected by Zenon's curse) sets out to defeat the Overlord. In the opening there is an attempt to summon Zenon to Adell so he can fight him, but it goes awry and Zenon's daughter accidentally gets summoned instead. Bound to Adell by the summoning pact she has no choice but to accompany him to the castle where he intends to kill her father (albeit not without scheming a bit herself). In a nutshell, the story is good. Nothing amazing but with ample opportunity for the humor most have come to love about the original.The only really new additions to the battles are the ability to do Stack Attacks and, if you are quick enough, throw diagnally. The basis of stack attacks are that after building the tower of aliies using the lift command, the person on the bottom of the tower still has the ability to attack. In doing so they begin passing the enemy up the tower with everyone taking a shot at him and then spiking him back to the ground. Essentially, a team attack of up to 10 characters. There have been updates to the Dark Assembly with 6 factions of Senators being introduced. And it can be easier to pass some bills if you are lucky since quite often some senators will show up to vote drunk (random vote basically) or even asleep (no vote at all). Perhaps the most entertaining addition though is felonies. You can recieve a felony for things such as power leveling, having to much hp/so/mana, or even killing your own allies. The benifit of felonies is that on top of any stat boosts you may get, it is easier to pass proposals at the Dark Assembly, and for every felony on a character they gain 1% extra exp. This works all the way up to 300 felonies (300% exp bonus).The game has made all the necessary additions to make the game-play top that of the original, however in my opinion there feels like something is missing. The characters seem a bit more "by the book" and not as wonderfully absurd as the original. That and the voice acting isn't quite as good as the that of the first Disgaea (plus Etna has a new voice actress...). Despite all of that however, the game plays much better and even looks a bit smoother to boot. All in all it is a great game and a worthy sequel to an amazing game. While some may like the changes in the characters and others may not, there is no denying that the core of the game is much better than the original and will keep you addicted for just as long, if not longer
- This is by far the worst instance of overzealous copy protection I've ever experienced.  I bought this game new at a local store because I've been itching to play SimCity 4 but that game will not work with my new video card.  Got this game home and it installed just fine, but when it came time to launch the game, it said disc authentication failed.  Tried it with the other disc, failed again.  Went to the company's support forums and found a lot of other people with the same problem and no one had done anything to help them.  Thankfully the people at the store were very reasonable and gave me a full refund
- Don't buy it unless you want the Starforce malware on your computer.  I understand publishers wanting to prevent piracy, but not at the expense of replacing the drivers I need(ed) for my DVD burner.  Check the search engines and see for yourself.  Would have otherwise been a great game, too bad it isn't playable because of this malware
- Starforce....nothing else need be said. Starforce singlehandly has destroyed a number of "could be" great games...I don't know since not a single one will play on a Dell XPS "Gaming" Laptop
- I bought this game because it sounded like a lot of fun.  I tried installing it on my Dell laptop and no dice.  It would not run.  I tried installing it on my Dell desktop computer and again, it would not run.  When I went to the knowledge base, technical support lists that if you have an integrated video card, the game will not work on your system.  In short, if you have an "over the counter" system, you cannot run this game on your computer.  I find this ridiculous and disappointing.  I would not suggest buying this game until you go to their technical support page and go over all of the requirements for game play.  Especially since these little facts are not listed on the box
- This game sucks.  It tries to be Sim City with extra features.  Unfortunately, the graphics are way below average.  In fact, some of the screens look like they were designed by a first year art student.  The Interface is clumsy and not intuitive.  I am a big fan of the Sim City series and this game really falls short
+ I bought it for my grandson and have not heard any complaints as a matter of fact I haven't heard any noise he is to busy playing it
+ Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus is said to be the last spin off (aside PSP's Crisis Core), and the one that goes furthest into the future of the VII world. The game seems like a must-play for Final Fantasy VII and Vincent Valentine fans alike, and it is. Thinking, most of those fans probably play mostly RPGs, this game is relatively easier than popular FPS (shooters) like Halo. Being an RPG-fan, yet still wanting to learn the story of the game, I was very happy for the easy difficulty (though it can be bumped up to something more difficult and there are plenty of extras that are difficult to get outside the story mode.) The controls are a little bad, but nothing that someone can't get used to. For one of Square's second or third shooter games, this one is pretty good.I'd recommend if you're doing what I did and playing it for story, then get the official guide so you can get all of the hidden capsules as you go (which unlocks the cutscenes and once you retrieve them, you never have to get them again). The guide is actually pretty good for this game, as well as the soundtrack. If you're a fan of the Final Fantasy music, definitely pick the soundtrack up.Lastly, if you're a Final Fantasy fan or RPG fan, get this game and everything related to it. It's worth it. I couldn't put this game down, even if some characters are a bit under-developed.If you're a shooter fan for games like Halo you will probably be disappointed
- This game has StarForce copy protection, which is software that you do not want on your computer. Reportedly, it replaces your CD and/or DVD drivers, and often causes extreme hardware and software problems. I've been a victim of the software problems, it basically crippled my very expensive SCSI scanners and it was extremely difficult to figure out what was doing it. It could be the best game that's ever been produced, but anyone who's had the StarForce experience is going to steer clear
+ This controller feels great in your hands.  In fact, after using this controller for awhile, my batteries went low and I had to switch back to the Dualshock controller.  The Dualshock felt wierd in my hands.  The response of the controller is good.  I have had the controller for a long time now and have not experienced any lag time.  One down side to the controller was that I returned two controllers because they has stopped working in a short period of time.  I guess the 3rd time is the charm because this one is working fine after almost a year
- I purchased this remote control to make watching DVD's on the PS2 easier.  I had problems getting it to work consistantly right out of the box.  I had to press most of the buttons very hard to get them to work.  I hoped it would get better but it only got worse.  I am now back to using the game controler and threw the remote control away.I would NEVER recommend this product. 
- I know that Pelican screen protectors and styluses are tempting because they're always the cheapest ones available.  That should tell you something.First of all, the top screen uses adhesive.  It's smooth plastic in the middle, but the edges will leave sticky goo on the screen.  Because the edge is a different material than the middle, it's insanely difficult to squeeze the air bubbles out of it, and being adhesive, trying again and again isn't much of an option.  Furthermore, the sticky edge is white, not clear, and it looks horrible on my onyx DS Lite.After having so much difficulty with the top screen protector, I checked online for reviews.  I read several reports of people who used the Pelican styluses with the Pelican bottom screen protector and the screen protector being very drastically scratched up within an hour's worth of use.  So, whether the stylus is too harsh for the bottom screen protector or the screen protector was too flimsy for the stylus, the combination just doesn't work.Many people report simply throwing their Pelican Write and Protect sets into the trash, so I'm not the only one that paid Pelican money for something that's going into the trash can.  No matter how inexpensive Pelican's product is, it's still too expensive if you end up throwing it in the trash too.I know I'm going to avoid the Pelican screen protectors and styluses in the future, and I very much wish that there were reviews here on Amazon before I bought mine.  I had to dig through Nintendo DS forums to read other peoples' opinions.Finally, if you already bought one and hate it, you can remove it by using scotch tape on the edges to peel it off and rubbing alcohol to remove the residue
- This is Supposed to be an x-box cleaner, but the system does not read the disc.  A shoddy product
+ I have had three of these Logitech Wireless controllers now.  They have all broken nearly seven months to the day I buy them.  The problem is the same every time, the left analog stick breaks.My girlfriend got me my first one in December 2004 (Christmas).  It lasted until about July 2005.  I exchanged it at the store, and the new one lasted until maybe February 2006.  I exchanged it again and now my third one has just bit the dust in September 2006.  I am not really a heavy gamer.  I play Madden and NCAA 2007 sparingly.  I am very disappointed with this repeat problem.  I also notice the "X" button sticking issue that others refer to here.  I tried putting a little graphite in there to make it not stick.  That seemed to work for a while.  You really can't beat the convenience of wireless, and every other aspect of the controller is great except the durability. 
- People, I don't know what you see in this game.  It's not really a bad game, it's just an average arcade shooter.  More often than not, I can't even hit the enemy because the action occurs so quickly.  I pop out from behind something and I'm dead meat.  Pick up the second one to see what it was like to play a good Time Crisis game
+ I have the same opinion as everyone else, the controller is very convenient, appealing, affordable and fun, but......it suddenly stopped working....I think there are some problems with the wireless connection, and its very frustrating being in the middle of the action and BOOM....your controller stops respondind..... and you get killed.....IT SUCKS!!!I see that a lot of people have the same problem that I do....what I do to solve it, is changing the batteries and then putting them back again, or use the dual shock for a while and then plug the logitech again...that has worked for me.....it sounds silly but somehow works....so, if you want a great wireless controller, this is it, but be aware that this problem is a little annoying and you probably will have it too...... 
+ I've never bought a wireless controller before...so I wasn't sure what to expect. But it turns out, this is probably the most comfortable video game controller in the world. the Logitech Wireless PS2 Action Controller is every bit as comfortable as the DualShock 2, and then some. It's a very curvy controller that fits almost too perfectly into the palms of your hands, and the buttons are placed great. The buttons never noticeably stick, the full D-Pad is Hundreds of times better than Sony's segmented D-Pad, and the analog sticks are EXTREMELY sensitive, responding to the lightest touch, and there are the start/select/analog buttons there 9though analog is called Mode on this controller), and a new button that turns vibration on or off. The placement of these four is good enough as you won't be using them often anyways.Lag time is wonderful for this controller. There is NO noticeable lag whatsoever. The radio frequency causes NO interference, and the reciever is small and barely noticable, if not a bit, dare I say it, "cute".The controller's weight is excellent too. It runs on batteries, yet is unbelievably light. The battery door does not stick out on the back uncomfortably either. Your batteries will also last you from 50 - 300 hours with vibration on/off. You won't even know you're playing with it when you're in the middle of a violent gunfight somewhere. It's just that good. The size is also comfortable and barely larger than the DualShock 2. Plus, there are no cords to trip over, pull out of the controller slot, or add to the mess of cords behind your entertainment center.There is ONE small bad point about this. The vbration feature is not as good as the DualShock's. But there are just TOO MANY good things here about this controller that make it invaluable to buy, even with this minor drawback.The Verdict: Guilty on the charges of being The most invaluable piece of PS2 hardware (aside from the console itself!) in the world. Sentenced to be bought by consumers around the world. Case dismissed
- I'd like to give this game a good review, but unless you read the fine print, you may be as dissapointed as I was to discover that it doesn't work on LCD televisions.  It also is incompatible with rear projection and plasma television sets
+ From using only two cordless controllers; this one and the XBox 360's controller, I like this one a LOT more. It's comfortable, small enough to not be too big, and just the right weight as to not be too light. I couldn't ask for a better controller- unless Logitech made the wired controller with the leather handles into a wireless one, then I'd find myself that much more pleased :) Buy this one, there isn't a better wireless controller out there
- This game has a good concept, nice graphics, and some definitely funny moments, but the game-play is a total bore. There are two main game-play styles: "investigation" and "trial". Investigation is the worst; it involves nothing more than checking everything in a room, talking to everyone, and a ton of pointless reading, much like an old point-and-click adventure on PC. The court sections are a little better, but not much. Once again, it's very linear; you don't have to use your brain much, just try all the options. And once again, there is a huge amount of reading. There is way too much dialogue packed into the game, and not near enough actual game-play. And most of the talking is aimless, too; very little of it actually advances the plot.Overall, this game just tried way too hard to have good plot and characters, and left the player with little more to do than click on objects and scroll through text
- My nephew really needed a new controller.  So I ordered this along with a game for his birthday.  The game was received fine, but he never received the controller.  I finally got notification of shipping delay several weeks later.  Yet the controller still listed as ships within 24 hours on Amazon.  The delays kept coming and eventually it just turned into a cancelled order by Amazon.  So the 1 star is for the service, the delay, and the lack of full explanation.  Who knows, the controller could have been wonderful??
+ I came upon this game as a demo from SONY. I downloaded it onto my PSP and was hooked within 5 minutes. I needed to have the full game. Don't let the child-like voices and images steer you clear of this game if you are an older gamer. Trust me, you will have some fun.The only thing is, I did beat it a little too fast. Still very fun
- The Playstation controller is nice. However the Nintendo 64 user would remember that the N64 controller was just a snazzy, maybe even more so. The XBOX controller is like a brick when compared to both. The PS2 delivered on a vibrating Dual Shock controller as standard with the unit. This controller feels great with the thumb pads / thumb sticks allowing for all sorts of movement. Suddenly in 2005, four years after the PS2 was released, games like Metal Gear Solid III: Snake Eater and God of War improve on this thumb pad function with the new mini-games feature. The controller has been given new life because of this.The big negative is the problem that Sony PS2 controllers are extremely poor quality. This controller, for all its design, will give you a dual shock. First of all you will be shocked at how suddenly they break. Drop it on the floor and you will easily damage the L1, L2 or R1, R2 wing buttons. Even if you don't drop it the wing buttons will usually break in less than a year if you enjoy gaming. The next shock is going through so many of these controllers because of this design flaw. Adding up the cost of each controller I could easily have bought myself another PS2 and then some more. The cord also has an uncanny ability to just wrap around itself and kink. I have never seen one that managed to remain straight. Also when a button breaks it tends to release little pieces into the controller so even if you don't need that button for the game the controller feels like it has sand rolling around inside of it.For all its handheld conditioning the controller is far from robust. I have used a very similar Logitech Cordless Rumblepad 2 for the PC that is the same design as the PS2 controller and that is a proper robust model. Just comparing the two side by side makes the PS2 controller look like it was developed in the USSR in the early 80s or something. The fact that Sony have done absolutely nothing to improve on the quality of their own generic PS2 controller is probably the reason why they have made so much money out of the PS2 unit. It is a way too expensive even if the controller was more robust. I hope Sony get it right with the PS3 next time. Make these controllers more robust please. The PS2 controller was always far from a quality device since its inception and is the only item that let the PS2 down badly
- 1 star for looking at the game cover in the store, 2 stars for the visual and audio and playinggggg.-Walk, pick up specified items, push things, use a few gadgets.-Those save points that are maddening rather than save as you go.-Things to do over for the another character.-Same collection of villans over and over.-The cut scenes are sketched for you and the narration is on and on.-(why do the houses look so similar.)-Stuff in the houses that you can not touch. boring.-Find Things you need but can not use yet and have to go back for it.-Not so puzzle solve as much as fetch this and that.-No free range chicken, doors are often locked.-Had to catch same snakes more than 3 times (weeee)-Atleast if you fail a task you get to try again. -REMEMBER nothing goes well, from the get go.-I found no cheats online for this game as of yet... -Dont play the piano, you hit buttons when they float by on screen.-The kids are cute and each special gadget and moves such as they are.I have Never read these books but there is a Warning at the start of the game that this is depressing and states nothing comes out right for these kids.If you want to try this game rent it.If you want to buy this game for someone......make sure you don't mind making yourself depressed for spending the cash and them for playing it.. Do you play the game or does it play you? :-
+ At TGS (Tokyo Game Show) 2005, Sony of Japan announced that they were developing an original game for PSP: LocoRoco. Instead of the usual ports or re-creations or compliations of retro games, LocoRoco is a completely new venture. It focuses on a fictional planet where happy LocoRocos (yellow blobs) and MuiMuis (blue figures) live. One day, it is invaded by the Moja Troop, who eat LocoRoco. Your job is to tilt the surface to lead LocoRocos through their planet without getting eaten. You collect flowers, which gives you another LocoRoco. You can combine and separate LocoRocos, as well. You collect bugs as a food source for LocoRocos. Additionally, when you collect MuiMuis, you can get house parts.The game is very easy. As a PSP player of Tekken:DR, complicated combo moves and annoying nuisances with the analog stick make PSP games hard to play--especially ports that we're used to seeing on PSOne and PS2. With LocoRoco, you use 3 buttons during game-play. The shoulder buttons (LEFT and RIGHT) are used to tilt, tapping the circle button separates LocoRocos, holding the circle button combines them, and holding down both shoulder buttons makes your LocoRocos jump. A lot easier said than done. A demo disc found at EBGames and a demo for download on the PSP Memory Stick show these capabilities and can be found for download at http://www.us.playstation.com/locorocopcdemo. You must have v2.71 for this to work, I might add.Besides a "  career" mode, which pivots you into different courses with different color LocoRocos, there are "mini-games" like a Mui-Mui Crane, Chuppa game, and more. You must collect a certain amount of bugs/pickories every game to play these games. Also, there is the LocoRoco House Editor feature that allows you to create a house for your LocoRoco. I haven't yet tested it out but it is an excellent feature, I presume. By collecting MuiMuis in games, you get house parts and you can build a house for your LocoRoco.Besides all of the game-play features, a large soundtrack is full of bubbly, interesting, and catchy jingles with unique voices. While some find it annoying, it is very catchy and it gets stuck in my head. LocoRocos even sing along in gibberish while the song goes on. MuiMuis do, as well. The graphics are 2D like Mario, which make loading times non-existant and shows off the capability of the PSP's high-performance graphics.In the end, LocoRoco is a game that is intuitive, simple, and beautiful to look at. It is fitted only for the PSP, and it should. Additionally, the game-play is excellent, pivoting you into many different scenarios with many different characters (like Moja, who attack you or Chuppa, who catapults you into hidden areas). It is clearly worth $40--clearly.PROS-Intuitiveness and Simplicity: Easy to play, fitted for the PSPShows off PSP Graphic Capabilities: Beautiful to look atDifferent Maps, Characters, Colors: Very unique and freshNot a Port or Re-creation/compliation: A completely original gameNo Long Loading Times: 2D graphics prevents thisMini-Games: Lets you take a break from main gameplayCONS-Longevity: Only 40 levels makes you wish for more...Should've Used Characters More: Some characters pop up once...You have to pay money made in career to access mini-games5/5: FUN5/5: GRAPHICS5/5: GAMEPLAY4/5: PLAYABILITY19/20: TOTA
+ This is a great controller.Especially after all the complaints microsoft had got about its original controller being too bulky(Personally speaking I never really had problems with even that).But since I got Xbox Controller S, I havent touched the big one.This controller gives a better grip,buttons are softer and their positioning is better(the overall feel is quite good).I played rallisport challenge with this controller and beat the whole game. Even in a game like rallisport where precision is required in accelaration and braking to successsfully  master the tracks,I did it without any problems using this controller.Also the vibration feel is very good.So if you are looking to buy an Xbox controller and are not being able to decide which,just go for this smaller one,Controller S without any hesitation.Quality hardware
+ This controller is great. You are able to play games much easier with this one than with the first manifest. This controller should be considered better than the dual shock because it is more comfortable and for people like me who play games for long periods of time that is a plus
+ I've played them all and enjoyed them all. Sorry this was the last one
+ I've only had this controller for a few days, and I have found that the layout is the same as the black controller. I do wish that the thumb controls were a little softer, as they hurt my thunb while playing an exciting game
- I got this game during the summer expecting it to be great fun. Well...it caught my interest for a few weeks then I just got bored with it. I'd only recomend it to people who do not get bored easily
+ In case you haven't' noticed this is a controller not a game. So as far as the controller goes, it works great and I have not had a single problem with it.
- I bought this game 5 days ago and when I finally got it it was missing a piece of plastic in the middle so that I could not play the game and the case was also damage
- When I first played this game, I got bored in 10 minutes.All you do is shoot and kill people for nothing, have the police chase you and you shoot them, Bring girls into your car and do it with them. I don't recommend this game at all its overrated
- When I bought the Xbox on 6-11-06 it came at a very good rate of time, my son enjoyed it then as we returned from a vacation he turned it on and we saw smoke I don't feel paying for an item at this price was fair to only have it for two months. I can't say the  person that sold me the Xbox has even tried to email me since I've emailed him , hmmmm.
- This game is horrible. I rented it for 5 days and returned it 3 hours after I rented it. I had wasted 5 bucks. Its pathetic. You cant do anything, graphics are horrible, cut scenes are as long as some commercials, and the characters are gay. Pros: Sunny can bite, garcons: Horrible graphics only 3 playable characters Bad humor Short cuteness cant do anything1 path game hardly 3d, (seriously, it doesn't look like it
+ It is not a false advertisement, it is just meant for the newer models of the PlayStation 2 that have a built in IR receiver, which is why it doesn't include it
+ Ok-I did not review any of the other comments on this game before posting this. I have been playing Final Fantasy games for a very long time... I still have (and play :p) Mystic Quest, Final Fantasy II and FF III for SNES. FF XII is the BEST Final Fantasy since #3 (US), in my opinion...and it is FUN!!!! The story line is AWESOME (kinda like Shakespeare meets King Arthur) and it reminds me a bit of final fantasy 3...only with awesome graphics!My one peeve for all of the games was leveling up (HP and MP.) I felt like after I mastered the "new" way of doing it-they changed it for the next game!!! The old games did it automatically...after those, you had to equip things in order to gain strength, magic, and special abilities. This game combines what you have already learned from FF VII on...and if you have never played the game, there is a great tutorial that you can access at any time.This game is just plain FUN...I think the MOST fun since FF III. You have the freedom to explore and wander without getting lost (there is a reminder at the bottom of the map and X's to show you where to go), you can see whatever you come into contact with (friends and foes), and the storyline and game-play are phenomenal
- This extension cable did not work with my standard Microsoft S Controller.  Unless you still use the old monster-sized Xbox controller, these cables are worthless
+ I finished almost all final fantasy games. (FF1 - 10, 10-2, FF Tactics).  I would say that this FF XII is the best game-play in final fantasy I ever dream off since my childhood.  I will summarize as follows.1.  Game play:  I would rate this 10 stars but here the max is just 5.  The game looks boring at first, but once you get a party and the A.I. system ( called Gambit in the game ), this is extremely fun.  The battle environment is superb.  Looks much like real battle.  No battle scene.  No random battle.  Everything appears on the map.  Multiple attacks can land on the enemy at the same time.  The camera view is half-global (you can see everything, if there is no obstacle, from front, behind, left, right, and above, not below though since the floor is an obstacle.)  THIS IS LIKE THE REAL THING.  THE THING I WANT TO SEE IN FINAL FANTASY!2.  Graphic:  superb.  The rendered texture looks inferior to FF X and FF X-2, when these two have the highest quality of the cut scene displayed.  But the over all cut scene is better since in FF X and X-2, there are sometimes that the cut scene looks really bad.  I am more satisfied to something that is smoothly good on average, not too good cut scene and then extremely bad at times.3.  Music:  Superb.  Thus far, no normal battle music, but that does not matter.  The music is not so great when you listen separately, but it suits the game environment a lot.4.  Trivia:  the town is so huge.  Look like the real town.  Approximately more than 50-100 people you can talk with in each town.  The costume looks so different.  It is not just like the old series of this game where the town person in town A may looks exactly alike that in another town if you notice.  But in FF XII, you have to notice meticulously to see that similarity.  Overall, everyone looks unique!Another thing I would say that the environment looks much like STAR WARS + LORD OF THE RINGS, though I put more emphasis on the former.  If you watch STAR WARS Episode I, you will see why I think it looks much like STAR WARS.Cons:  I would say that these cons is nothing compared to the pros.1.  Storyline.  Quite simple.  No plot twist thus fat I have played.  Not many things stimulate the players to want to know what will happen next.  Unlike FFX, that game introduced many interesting plots from the beginning and gradually unraveled them as the game proceeded.  I would say that if you were to watch only the movies ?and the cut scene, FFXII sounds like a normal  battle story in the middle age. (But why there are so many hi-tech transportation?)2.  Voice.  I would say that the voice actors in this game is quite disappointing.  They did the good job, I admitted, but their voices doesn't seem to sound good.  For example, compared to FF X, the main female protagonist has the unique voice, but that in FF XII sounds like typical American people.  The second main female protagonist in FF X sounds unique, but that in FFXII sounds ok, not so great.  The main antagonist in FF X sounds mysteriously great, but that in FFXII sounds quite dull.  The only one that I think he sounds ok is the main male protagonist.
+ I will try to keep this brief... by the way I'm only 10 hrs through... only just got out of City #1 Rabernastre, Dalmasca and now in city #2 Bahjerba (so?):Quickly, my first impressions of the game were strange... I was like "MEH I dunno if I want to keep playing..." but after maybe 20 min of getting of the 'weirdness' it really sucks you in. Ugh I really wish I didn't have midterms coming up so I could go home and play!Pros:- Love the battle system! It's still strategy but it doesn't require you to have random battles... ugh I'd hate the "whzzzhhh" of the starting of random battles... I can still feel in control but doing less actual work.- Like everyone else says, CG always good.- Story... though not as much character development/focus as previous ones, I do like the whole war/polity centered plot. It does follow FFT's tradition.- I actually like the license board... some people have said it's a pain in the beginning, but so far it hasn't been the case for me... granted I did very early in the game decide to level up Vaan a bit (~40 min or so). You really just need to know to only use the board when you really need to... don't randomly buy spots on the board just as things become available as its difficult for one person to learn EVERYTHING. Plan, plan, plan. (Right now by the way I'm constructing my chars in the way the game hints at... its only one way to do it, but first time around I'll follow it... the already licensed equipment/abilities hint at what they'll be good at.)- HUGE game. Lots of stuff to see... and quite beautiful.- Character design... course there is always someone to love... (Har har har... as a fangirl I must say I love Basch :D lol... tho I love the babyface of earlier FF characters I think Vaan is too babyfaced. He looks like a kid.--haha I'm a college student and such a fangirl... haha... sad isn't it?--If I were a guy, I'd say I'd like Fran the most... this is of course subject to personal opinion.)- I like subs and I like how they are not bland... they have fancy font this time :D. (Kinda reminds me of Nochnoi Dozor.) Makes the game really movie-ish.- Widescreen capability... (Looks SWEET on my widescreen PC monitor.)- Course everyone always talks about the realism of selling pelts and what not... I also like that.- Free-moving camera... Thank heaven for that. I LOVE it. I hated the still camera immensely in FFX.- Cute monsters... lol love the cactuar like monster and the rogue tomato!- Also love how you can avoid some boss moves by skillfully moving around them.Cons:- HUGE game... (yes also a con)... lots of time running around. Good thing all the characters don't run as painstakingly slow as Tidus did in FFX.Meh... neutral:- Voices - I dunno what is up with people liking the previous FF's voice actors but anyhoo I thought this time there were better ones. The prev. FF's voice actors were okay but not great. Here the voice actors are really good, but the choice of some of them seems strange... like I have a problem with Fran's voice... it was a strange choice and a strange voice. Also Balthier's voice doesn't seem to go with his look, but I really do like the voice acting by itself. (In sum, some voices, though really well acted, didn't seem to fit the actor's look... however, I do favor good actors with mismatched roles over okay actors with well-matched roles so I  give the voice acting a mild thumbs up.) After reading a review which mentioned mispronunciations, I feel I must also address that... As someone who speaks some French I did twitch when I heard "Marquis" pronounced both as "Markus" and "Marquis" rather than "Markee." I also did twitch when they pronounced "fete" as "feet" rather than "feh-t."- Soundtrack - I liked all the music (there was a lot) taken from FFT... esp the battle music in the Estersand, I think it is... totally taken from FFT (obviously as both take place in the same world)... I did enjoy the non-midi renditions of the themes... but the rest of the new guy's music was just 'meh'... wasn't particularly bad, but it didn't really stand out much either
- Tediously long and weary. Nothing interesting, just a lot of borrowed ideas from RTCW, HL2, etc. I am sick of this
- Beautiful graphics and nice storyline, but the amount of times the game freezes or you receive an error is just awful! Not to mention, the monsters level up with you so you'll never be at an advantage. You could pretty much beat the game at level 5 
+ The GTA series has created a new thresshold in video games. With creation of GTA 3, games became increasingly more violent and more controversial. San Andreas is no exception.If this game did not bear the GTA tag, I probably would have rated it higher, but needless to say, I'm a bit disappointed with what rockstar did with this addition to the GTA series. Previous GTAs all had a quirky jab at political and social icons (particularly conversation political and social icons). San Andreas had this, but to a much lesser extent which disappointed me.Another thing which disappointed me about this game was the RPG-like system they put into it. Your accuracy is determined by how often you practice, rather than the players ability to shoot. Also, unlike previous GTAs, you must now press a button  and slow your walking speed down to manually aim and fire a gun. I HATED this change in the game-play. This severely limits your ability to go on rampages, and forces you to use their god-awful auto aim system. If they had not added this function to the game, I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more.That being said, there were PLENTY of things I enjoyed about this game. First off, I enjoyed the new depth they've added to missions. Previously missions were as followed: Kill this, blow up that, run way from these guys, and avoid cops. Missions in this game actually feel like Rock star put a lot of time into each individual objective. One Mission that particularly comes to mind is the mission where you hop on a plane, have a small shootout on the INSIDE of the vehicle, then fly to liberty cities (a location that you cannot travel to normally) and assassinate some crime bosses. Little things like this show the extra effort the designers put into the game.Another thing I enjoyed about this game is that it is more challenging than previous GTAs. The very last mission will have you cussing like mad if you haven't achieved fire proofing from the firetruck missions. This game is designed at a skill level for someone who has been playing GTA a long time.Also the map is frigging huge! Its about 3 times the size of your regular GTA game. However, unlike previous GTAs, its not packed with little goodies and have special jumps at every corner. Its still fun to explore every corner of the map in this game though.So now for the break down of my review Pros-Incredibly large map-Challenging-More new vehicles to hijack-An overall improvement on the missions-Plenty of extra features-GANG WARS-Good voice acting The Cons-New style of shooting is a huge hindrance-Areas are not as packed with goodies as before-Fewer political cheap shots than SA's predecessors Overall I would give this game a 8 out of 10 in comparison to video games everywhere, but only 4 out of 10 when compared to its predecessors (5 being average).One other note: If you have an ATI Radeon x700 you may encounter some problems playing this game (not with lag, but with actually loading the game)
+ Not really being into the original GTA III (and its birds-eye-view predecessors), I became unfortunately addicted to to San Andreas. The game play is absorbing and the storyline and cinematics are, despite the dated graphics, engaging. Maybe the most impressive aspect of the entire game is the impressive cinematic scene voice acting, which makes you forget about some of the jerky animations.The game play is free-ranging, but if you don't pursue the main storyline missions (which are linear, but multiple storylines let you pursue them in any priority) the gratuitous violence you can commit is ultimately unrewarding and difficult to get away with (as it should be). The moral criticisms of the game include being able to randomly assault innocent bystanders without repercussions, but for the most part, there are repercussions if nearby police see you doing so. My criticism would be that there are not enough repercussions for street violence, because it would certainly make that aspect of the game more challenging. If you go on a rampage in a local store, the clerks don't try to call the police or evade. They instead just take a beating or a bullet. The AI of some of the rival gangs is a little clumsy too, as they will simply start shooting at you if they see your colors, despite the presence of squad cars or bike cops across the street. The cops in San Andreas are corrupt, but not that corrupt.GTA SA definitely feels like a ported title rather than a game developed for PC. Some of the interface and in-game menus are awkward and designed to be PS2 game-pad friendly. Saving the game is a bit of a pain as well, since you have to retreat to your "safe-house" to save every-time.A fun and engrossing game for adults, but let this be known: if you let your under-18 child play this game, you are an awful parent and deserve to have social services come and whisk your precious babies away. Aside from the violence, San Andreas is rife with profanity and innuendo, and is probably not really suitable for anyone under 40. There is no "safe" mode or low-gore level for this game like some other titles (while the game is overly violent, gore is minimal anyway)
- I bought the game couple of weeks ago. I was hesitating on buying it initially, but finally I did because of all the good hype about the game. I wish I didn't buy it.To be fair, I have to admit that the game has astonishing landscape, cities and the level of details in the game. I don't think I have ever seen suhc creativity and perfectness in earlier games. I am sure that are lot of people that will find such features enough for them to adore the game.For me, landscape is not enough since the largest downside is the story, if there is any story, "from my perspective". I have abandoned playing after closing the 4th or 5th Oblivion gate. I don't see any excitement in playing the game any further. I explored most of the cities though, quite quickly. The conversation looks silly that every time the camera will zoom in to the person you are chatting with. It was nice the first couple of times but then ....I am waiting for my sweet gothic3 to go out. Honestly I would prefer playing Gothic1 on playing oblivion. Just to tell you about the action/excitment I am talking about, I would like to say that when I got gothic2 I played for almost 36 hours straight no food no sleep just drink water and play play and lots of play.
+ As one might suspect GTA: San Adreas has the classic anarchist fun with insane driving, guns galore and a lawless protagonist, and a linear storyline. Let's be honest though; nobody buys GTA to JUST play the mission part and in fact I have a hard time getting into the missions. In San Andreas there is an even larger area of game-play and a few other cities to explore once you have advanced in the game (unless you want to cheat). The clear aspect that sets this game apart from the previous ones is the depth of game-play. Haircuts and tattoos are available for purchase. You have various parts of your character that can be built up--fat, hunger, muscle, driving skill, weapon skill etc. Obviously when you get fat you need to run around and eat when hungry. The others are self explanatory. Some new and rather interesting vehicles ave been added to this game. The hydra, which is a harrier type jet, the stunt plane, an attack helicopter, a four wheeler, a parachute, and my favourite--the jetpack. Other than that the game is like each created before it from GTA 3 on. The graphics even on a fairly modern computer still leave much to be desired. Whatever engine they use is clearly the same as GTA 3. Animation on the other hand is very natural and realistic. Music from the radio stations is lackluster, but I believe it is possible to use your own music instead. As a computer game San Adreas' controls at the very least awkward because of the sheer number of actions that can be done. In the worst case scenario--the hydra--however using a keyboard to fly the plane is downright nerve racking. If you want to shoot something below you, be sure to compensate by a couple of seconds, not because it moves fast but because you need that time to angle the nose of the plane in that direction. I, myself use an xbox controller which has an adapter to use the USB port on the computer. Even with that it is not much better and you still need the D-pad to make decent turns. As you can tell this is my biggest qualm with the game. Overall Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas has a lot to offer if you don't have a regular gaming console but that is compensated by the clumsy keyboard controls. I would rate it a 7 out of 10
+ The main appeal of the Grand Theft Auto franchise has always been the freedom it gives the player to explore vast amounts of territory and cause mayhem as he sees fit. San Andreas contains by far the most audacious expansion on the landmass available to you. This time the action takes place in California inspired locales such as Los Santos, San Fierro and the Las Vegas inspired Las Venturas, all within the enormous state of San Andreas. The main inspiration this time around is the fascination with ghetto culture that was so predominant in the early 90's. This provides a great opportunity for Rockstar to take advantage of the setting and implement some new challenges for the player to conquer. New to Grand Theft Auto is the concept of territory control, as a member of a street gang the player has the opportunity to take over every available territory in Los Santos later on in the game. Perhaps the most notable additions to the franchise are the ability to customize your character's appearance and improve his varied skills throughout the game. These may seem like rather superficial additions but they are surprisingly satisfying when implemented properly. The character's skill growth happens naturally and rarely interferes with the free form exploration that players have come to expect from the series. The customization of your avatar varies greatly and encompasses most fashion styles found during the early `90s in California. The lower tier stores offer the usual assortment of baggy pants and sports jerseys while the more expensive stores offer suits, expensive jewelry and trendy fashions. Your characters appearance can be as varied as you want it to be and it does not stop at just clothes and tattoos, his physical fitness can also be changed.The Grand Theft Auto franchise has improved in almost all aspects with each subsequent release and this one proves to be no different. As the last game in the series to use this outdated engine it pushes it as far as it can go in terms of graphical prowess. The graphics are slightly improved over the previous installment but they remain sub par to the standard featured in most games released around the same time. Nonetheless the visuals are quite effective as the sunsets fill San Andreas in an orange tint and the game's color palette faithfully replicates the feel of the early nineties California culture.The soundtrack aptly replicates the time period which San Andreas draws its visual style from and perhaps the one complaint on this subject would be that Rockstar seems to try and encompass far too many genres of music. The expected genres can be found, such as Hip-Hop and Alternative Rock, both of which had a strong presence in the early nineties pop scene. However, some stations seem oddly out of place in the game world's era. Dance music and Funk each get their own stations yet it hardly seems worth it, although too much choice is never a bad thing. Making a welcomed return are the various radio station DJ, who each pepper the time between tracks with hilarious chat and amusing observations. For those that would prefer to listen to nothing but banter there are two radio stations with a talk radio format, one public station holding discussions on the day's political events and another with light talk shows. Either one of these stations is more than enough to keep the player amused for hours but just in case the PC version gives you the added bonus of playing your own MP3 tracks by adding them to the game's music library.The sound effects themselves seem appropriate but never particularly impressive. There is the usual banter among pedestrians and the complaints from motorists as you pull them out of their vehicle and run off with their ride. All these things add a little bit of life to the game's large cities and the voice work varies enough to cover all the different geographical areas that San Andreas contains. The thick southern accents of the countryside inhabitants and the snobbish tone of the civilians in the rich neighborhoods are all present. The gunfire and explosions sound average, with not much improvement present since Vice City.Despite the controversy that seems to follow every release in the series San Andreas is a praiseworthy title in and of itself. An engrossing action game that continues to expand its limits while continuing to deliver what fans of the series have come to expect
- I can't believe how many people are saying how "realistic" this game is.  That can not be further from the truth.  All the CPU does is lob the ball down field on 3rd and long plays and the receiver catches it 80% of the time regardless of coverage.  What fun is that?  This in itself is highly unrealistic.  Don't even get me started on the other things this game does. NCAA 2006 is nothing but an arcade game, realism is thrown out the window in this one.  EA does not know the meaning of AI.  The only difference between the levels is the amount of cheating the CPU does.Don't waste your money, and don't make EA any more richer, its obvious they just throw these games together.  They just take our money and laugh all the way to the bank. 
- I really tried to like this game, being that EA chickened out and bought their way out of competition.The graphics and sound are great in this game, but its ruined by Ear's cheating AI. I have never seen a game cheat this much in my life. No matter what play you call the defence always knows what you are calling, even if you think you have them beat on a play, your receiver will purposely drop a wide open pass or better yet the defender turns on his notorious oxide that was installed in his uniform and cover half the field in 2 seconds to deflect a pass. If you throw a high pass, not to worry the lineman has installed jet packs which allows them to jump 10 feet in the air and deflect or pick off your pass. If the CPU wants you to lose you will lose no matter what you do. If you QB is going back for a pass and a lineman is 3 feet away from you, even if you press the passing button, your QB will just stand there so he can take a sack. This game is total BS, there is no way to get off passes in heavy pressure because the game forces you into a tackle animation. When you are playing defence, you are better off putting down your controller and clipping your nails or flossing your teeth while the CPU pulls of BS miracle plays on every single down. Remember how I said your receivers will purposely drop wide open passes? Not the CPU receivers, the CPU receivers, regardless of their rating can catch passes in double and triple coverage every time. if they don't catch it, the ball just gets tipped over and over again until he can catch it. Think you stopped a 3rd down conversion? Think again, you will get flagged for pass interference or a face mask penalty. And remember about your QB being forced into a tackle animation? Not the CPU, the CPU can get of 60 yard spirals while he's being hit! What about the inconsistency you ask? Well let me explain. How is it that one game you can be totally on, but the next game, you can't even complete ONE pass! I'll tell you why. The CPU wants you to lose, so you will drop every pass, fumble every run and get called for every penalty in the book. I was playing a game, and managed to run back a punt and KR for a TD, before my offense even touched the field. Then all of a sudden the CPU turned on its God Mode and every thing went right for the CPU. BS lobs, BS runs and BS calls. I did not complete ONE SINGLE pass in the entire first half. Its not because the CPU was playing good defence, its because my receivers dropped every ball that was thrown to them, wide open or not. I ended up only completing one pass in the entire game, 1 for 20 I think. At this point, I knew I had no chance of winning, so I just started punting the ball on first down to avoid any more frustration. My so called impact RB only got 2 yards on 20 rushes, and my so called impact CB gave up 3 TD passes to a below average receiver. What is the point of playing if you are not even given a chance to win? Yes you can win games as I have, but it is so inconsistent. If the CPU wants you to lose you will lose, nothing you can do about it.I see why EA bought the license, after putting out crap like this, they were sure to lose a lot of customers to a game that knows how to develop better AI, instead of this cheating crap. I am taking this game to the store for store credit and I am done with EA for good. EA sucks and so does this game
+ It works really well and their is no problem with the cable and the enhanced quality of the picture is much better that the original A/V Cables
- If you need a remote to turn on the tele and run the 360, this will do.  But it won't operate a DVR, DVD, VCR or cable box.  If you're really keen on it, I'll sell you mine.
- No way to change the inputs on your TV.The DVD functions and the TV functions are accessed alternately by pressing a "TV" button but there is no way to tell which the remote is aligned to. Therefore when you press the power button you have no idea which you will be powering on/off, the TV or the Xbox. And if things couldn't get any dumber, if you press the eject button while the remote is in TV mode it doesn't work. The eject button is only designed to work with the Xbox yet it is disabled when in TV mode? There is also no option to program a receiver.As many others mentioned, this remote looks nice but the people who designed it must have been drunk. Do not buy this remote unless you like wasting your money on garbage
+ This is a great cable for your HD TV while playing you Sony PlayStation 2. It give very crisp and clear images, much better than the cable that comes with the PlayStation.
+ These Component AV cables make a world of difference in video quality. Especially on HDTV. Some Images now appear pixelated, this may be the game I am playing. But everything else is smooth, crisp, and clear. Text is three times as easy to read. I recommend these for any HDTV owner
+ At first playing a Star Wars game made me feel very nerdy, but let me tell you if this is what nerdy is then it rocks!!!!! This game is incredible!!! It is very, very fun basically you choose what side you want and destroy the other what with gaining the several checkpoints that are throughout it. Buy this game and put your blasters on full
- Try before you buy! This game has a major glitch: its save game files are erased sometimes, so you can start all over again.Beware
- First, let me say that I whole-heartily agree with the review by Tiberius. Back in the glory days of Counter-Strike (2001-2002), this game was the be-all end-all for 1) Online video games, 2) First-Person Shooters, 3) PC Games, and 4) Any video game basically. It had real-life weapons, the graphics were superb at the time, the maps were extremely well-made, the system requirements are still obscenely low, and damn it it was fun. Then, inevitably, the hands of time began to take their ruthless, indiscriminate toll. Video cards supported better graphics, new (and yes, better!) games came out (Battlefield 1942, Unreal Tournament 2004), hacking became the unmistakable poison of Counter-Strike, and a lot of the cool, casual gamers grew up or moved on. From 2000 to 2004, Counter-Strike went from an utter joy to a sensation to a fading diamond to a nuisance. By 2004 to present day, it has become a problem. Great games and great game developers are losing tons of money because people are still playing this game after five years on their mom's worn-out 640 Megahertz Pentium III PCs running Windows 98. Counter-Strike is still one of the most popular games of all-time, with a ridiculous number of people playing it on average a day, because people just don't seem to have enough self-control to give up their hopeless addiction.Today, server admins are, for the most part, humorless dictators, and will not stand for anything that deviates from this game's undeniable, monotonous drone. People are still playing the same maps from the 1.0 release, that have completely lost all their zest and initial potential. It always feels as if I've played the same round a thousand times before, and I probably have. Even the custom maps are sickening in their monotony. fy_iceworld is fun for 3 consecutive seconds. Many other popular custom maps in heavy server rotation are the same way, and all look disgusting. I've played on probably over 500 servers, and downloaded probably over the same amount of *quality* custom maps, and not more than 3 have I ever seen a server run in its rotation, or voted on by the players. Furthermore, people are still playing the game using dial-up, and CS veterans are always complaining about camping, even if its a tactic used to complete the objective. As far as the objectives are concerned, Counter-Strike has basically become a death match game. No one will listen to anyone's plan (on the rare occasion there is one), no one tries to rescue the hostages, and everyone always calls someone a "p***y" or "nub" if you use the auto shotgun or AWP. And to top it all off, Valve cancelled the outstanding won.net and replaced it with this Steam garbage, a utility soaking wet with incompetence.L337 Speak has also gained mass popularity to the jaded Counter-Strike culture, and has become its own incessant frustration. But I won't even get into that. If you're new to CS, don't bother, veterans of this game are far from friendly, and you'll probably get called a bunch of names involving lots of zeroes and threes if you're a beginner. For now, if you want to indulge yourself in a great online game, check out World of Warcraft, Battlefield 1942, Sven Co-Op, or even Team Fortress Classic (a dated game with an *awesome* community that has yet to lose its initial charm)
- I'll make this short and sweet for you.  I went to a cyber cafe so I can play this "gem" and see what all the fuss is about on this game.  OVERRATED.  I have no idea how people praise this as "THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD!!"...How silly, This game is just plain average..  If you wanna play a nice Game from Valve..I don't need to tell you but I'll give you a hint....H***f L*fe...This game is just pure garbage and the Online is boring...And I don't need your flaming or bashing just cause One mans opinion differs from yours..The good Visuals are good I gustatory MediocerPlain boring combat...Nothing new Online isn't that great Extremity Overrated...TRUST ME..Gets boring after awhile And yes I played this out for more then an 1hour...2 bucks I'll never get back2.1 out of 5 stars....  Extremity Overrated, Not worth my 2 bucks, and that's all I got to say....Peac
+ There is no denying that Star Wars Battlefront is one of the best video game series that is currently available. The first game was really amazing, let us participate in some of the places seen in all six movies. But, even though the game was really fun, it felt like there was something still missing. The missing piece was put in and this is the result. This is not a disappointment, but the best! Unlike the first game when the main story game-play was just capturing bases and killing all of the enemy forces, here, there are actually missions to complete. From having to retrieve data-discs, to killing rebel leaders, this game is more in depth than it's predecessor. In game, there are still times when bases have to be captured, like in the first game, but you no longer have to kill all of the enemies. The coolest part of the game is that you get to ride in different ships and other things from the movies. Lots of fun!!So, overall, this game really is an improvement over the first but some may prefer the first more. The reason being that the first game is basically kill everyone and take their bases, and that is less seen here with the focus is more on protecting things and stealing things.
+ This is hands down the best star wars game I have played or seen. Just the fact that you can use almost every hero and villain in the star wars movies makes this a blast to play. The addition of the space combat is what really tips the scales on this title. When you're flying through waves of tie fighters and you land on an Imperial star destroyer and begin fighting through control rooms, you begin to realize this game is really special.
+ This game is really good.There's a wide variety of levels to play,and a very good multiplier system.The game only has a few faults, like a blown up frigate in space sometimes goes through the capital ship.The game also gets a little boring after a while.Besides that,its a great game
+ In this first person shooter you battle through the Star Wars battles through all episodes, fighting as soldiers on the Republic's side.  And you have the chance to play as a Jedi which has more power than a normal soldier.  And, you have the opportunity to do "instant action".  That is where you choose a battlefield and pick a side to fight as.  Also, you can choose to conquer a galaxy, but it's really boring.  This game is really fun, but it starts to get boring after awhile.  So, get some friends to play multi player or split-screen.  Also, Yoda is awesome
- If you are looking for an XBOX version of another chapter in MechWarrior series, this ISN'T it. This is an extremely dumbed-down version of MW. Even if you (Mechwarrior fans) forget about having no customization, remember this: You can only fire one weapon at at time. You have to cycle between lazers, cannons and rockets. I was bored after about 5 minutes.Again, people who never played MW series may like this game better
- As the opening cut scene introduces you to Blinx the cat, the supporting cast and the particulars of his upcoming adventures, I found myself trying to wrap my brain around the basic premise of the story. The idea is that a secret, off-world clan of humanoid cat creatures, armed with souped up vacuum cleaners, are responsible for the development and dispersal of time itself to every known plane of existence on the map. It seems that time, when compressed tightly enough to be transported by said cats, takes the form of one of five different brightly-colored shapes. If these crystals are left out on the open for too long without being properly introduced to the flow of things, they turn into monsters. I could go on, because the game certainly doesn't stop there, but I think you get the point. I like to think that there's a fairly thick line drawn between cartoony fantasy and super-detailed realism. Generally, a lot of the physics and environmental details are taken for granted in a realistic game, because they're almost exclusively set in a photo realistic, lifelike location. Cartoons, on the other hand, generally don't worry themselves with the particulars and are primarily concerned with delivering a good time. How much fun would the Wile E. Coyote cartoons be if every time the lead character suffered a grisly fate, it strictly obeyed the laws of gravity and aerodynamics? Blinx tries to straddle that thick line by delivering a story that's overly detail-centric in an environment that's right out of a kid's show. The result is a tale that comes off as way, WAY out of left field and almost completely abstract. It focuses on things that would be better left to the viewer's imagination and ignores the importance of a good underlying story along the way.Beneath the needless discussions of why there are monsters in the world, how time compression works and how cats are actually responsible for all that we hold dear, the actual plot is almost laughably straightforward and generic. There's a princess, evil pigs have kidnapped her, and it's up to you and you only to rescue her and save her world. That's it, no side-stories, no reasoning, no subplots - just a straightforward rush from Point A to Point B. And here I thought the phrase "save the princess" was universally recognized as an ages-old cliche.Now, I don't want it to sound like I'm railing on this game just because it's got a few more nit picky details than its peers and it reuses an old phrase from way back in the plat-former handbook as its sole driving factor. It's also completely lacking in character development, general storytelling and ongoing inspiration. None of the characters in Blinx really establish themselves as individuals, including the lead character himself. You don't hate the pig on the spaceship because he's trying to destroy the world, you hate him because every time he shows up he tries to steal your money. I honestly forgot there was a princess at the end of the game after level three, because she's never mentioned between the game's start and its finish. I mean, the very first Super Mario Brothers at least reminded you that the princess was in another castle at the end of every boss fight. I don't honestly think the game was really designed to be enjoyable so much as it was geared to be overly challenging. The first level and a half are set up in the standard "get to know you" format, with the simplest of enemies, the most routine of stage layouts and plenty of opportunities to mess around with your tools. Shortly thereafter, you're thrown to the wolves. For the most part, the level designs are very short, with more of an emphasis on cheap hits than on complexity and true challenge. I noticed a lot of overlap in the stage layouts, whether it's retracing your steps time and time again or walking along a catwalk (har har) above the beginning of the stage and invariably plummeting back to the start point. You'll almost always know what needs to be done, but actually accomplishing that act is the real trick. I just can't overemphasize how unbearably cheap most of this game really is. If there's a bottomless pit nearby, (and chances are very good that there is) Blinx will find a way to force himself into it, regardless of what you're hitting on the control pad. If there's an enemy two feet in front of you and you hit the attack button, he'll aim at a random switch on the other side of the room, rather than the imminent threat. That's not to say that the entirety of The Time Sweeper is totally without merit, because it does bring a few fresh ideas to the table, but for the most part those insights are hampered by their surroundings. The ability to control time, for instance, was at the time a really fresh, interesting new play mechanic and still stands out today, despite the limited field of imitators that have since emerged. You can rewind a few seconds to catch an enemy unaware or rebuild a crumbling bridge, pause the action and take advantage of the frozen time, knock the level into slow motion, etc. All the while, Blinx is moving around in real time. It's a great idea, but the implementation is painfully short and underutilized. Why can't I use two controls at the same time? Why don't more aspects of the stage encourage the player to experiment with and solve problems with these powers? Why doesn't the ridiculous ten minute stage time limit pause, speed up or rewind when I use my time powers? Why is their duration so brief, and why can't I hold more than a dozen uses at a time? I mean, this could have really been a fantastic experience if the time control aspect had been beefed up a little further and treated as more than just an auxiliary function of an otherwise run-of-the-mill platformer.The controls, too, are an undeveloped, under tested nightmare. Blinx himself is often sluggish to respond, especially when implementing his time controls. He has difficulty making a precise turn, whether on midair or on solid ground. He stops to briefly celebrate when gaining an item, which leaves him open to constant enemy attacks. He routinely moves in the direction of certain death, as though pulled by a magnetic field, whether you've instructed him to do so or not. He'll occasionally refuse to perform a double jump, particularly when attempting a difficult, precise leap across a gaping chasm. I think it's these controls that most make Blinx so mind-squashing aggravating. At a glance, you'd imagine they'd be fairly difficult to screw up. You've got a jump button, a suction / fire button, a time control button and an analog stick to control movement. Plus, there had already been a long, established line of three-dimensional platforms on the market in the years before the title's release, paving the way to an ideal control experience. Super Mario 64 had its issues, sure, but nothing like this, and it was the trailblazer for the entire genre's jump to the world of 3D. It's like they had a map leading them right to the treasure and decided to forge their own path anyway.I can't even say I'm impressed by the graphics showcased throughout The Time Sweeper, either. With the exception of the lead character himself, these are some incredibly cheesy, preschool ish character designs - they feel unfinished and hurried, less purposeful than you'd imagine (especially in contrast with Blinx himself). Particularly insulting is the large population of simple blobs that roam around the levels, trying in vain to bump into you and cause a fatal injury. Here's a finely detailed main character, with such close attention paid to his wardrobe that even the gloss of his shoes was obviously debated time and time again, and he's pitted against a set of monsters that could have sprung to life directly out of the pages of a four-year-old's sketchbook. Despite featuring a spoken dialog track, there's no English voice acting. I couldn't pinpoint the language, but my wife seems to think it's either French or some close variation of it. It certainly didn't sound Japanese. While this does add a touch of personality to the title, and it's not every day that you get a chance to hear a cat shouting something in the language of love, it all seemed really odd and out of place coming out of my television. Everyone's vocal personalities are so black-and-white, too, that I feel like a great chance to establish some much-needed individuality among st the cast was lost once again here. The bad guys all have the same deep, gravelly, transparently evil tone, while the good guys are all bright, cheery, squeaky and high-pitched like the monkeys in Super Monkey Ball. It's like a parody of the games that had come before, but I won't give the developers enough credit to assume that they were doing it on purpose.Overall, Blinx is really just a few promising concepts thrown together in one package, strapped to the shell of a far-below-average third person platformer and unleashed upon an unsuspecting public. At the time of its release, it was still in need of a lot of polishing, some serious scrutiny behind closed doors and a re-evaluation of just how far some of these concepts and half-hear ted character designs could be conceivably stretched without losing any quality. On top of that, I really don't know which audience they were targeting with it. The game is ridiculously difficult, which betrays the childlike demeanor that surrounds it and leads me to believe it was meant for the serious gamers out there, but so bright, kid-friendly and annoyingly cutesy that I can't imagine anyone in that demographic rushing out to the stores on release day. The number of spontaneous controller hurls shot through the roof during my time with Blinx, reaching near-Marvel vs. Cap com 2 levels with its unashamed, excruciatingly cheap hits, especially in later levels. I have no idea how I acquired the willpower to finish level eight.The game is adequately lengthy, and offers some replay value, with hidden cat medals in each stage eventually unlocking production sketches, promotional materials and the like. Once you start hunting for floating cat heads in those super-tough later levels, though, you'll remember why you were so happy to be finished with them in the first place. Unless you feel like pulling your hair out in clumps (I shaved my head after the experience as a part of the cleansing process) and enjoy self-mutilation, I'd recommend you stay far away
+ I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER BECAUSE SHE LOVES TO SING, I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA THAT IT WOULD BE SO FUN THAT THE WHOLE FAMILY WOULD JOIN IN AND PLAY FOR HOURS! IT WAS SO FUN THAT WE IMMEDIATELY HAD TO BUY THE KAREOKE CMT COUNTRY GAME ALSO.
- I hate this game its the worst game I've ever played
+ This game is great for when you have a group of friends come over. It really breaks the ice between you and anybody you may not be familiar with and it is incredibly entertaining.  I suggest this game for everybody
+ I bought this game for an adult birthday party. It was a hit.  The game is very entertaining and it is easy to navigate through the game.  You have full control of the settings such as music level, vocals, crowd noise, etc.  You can also change the mode to the traditional Karaoke in which only the words are displayed on the screen. It's definitely for all ages even my two year old can't get enough of it. The selection of music is good. Be sure to have a memory card so you can save any characters you create and keep track of your performance for unlock hidden treasures such as extra songs and wardrobes
+ This was the first karaoke revolution game that I received, and I enjoy it very much! However, the songs on the game I found were quite old, even for someone like myself, a senior in college. I don't know about the rest of you, but the 80's were a blur for me. I didn't know these songs very well, which can put a major hindrance on game play. I liked the high amount of songs they put on he recent game, but I have already ordered Karaoke Revolution Volume 3 after seeing more recent songs that I would know.I found the "sing and dance" mode to be challenging, and if you don't know the song by heart, don't play it, because you need to be watching the arrows for where your feet should be going. I would also recommend a wireless microphone for the dance pad (if they exist) since a cord will get in the way of your dancing moves.I thought it was really cool that the game had a sense of initiative, with over 50 different unlockable items (although 90% of which are items you can use to create your character, or just a new character). Some of the songs listed here need to be unlocked through game play. I'm sorry I couldn't think of every artist for these songs, but if it isn't listed, assume its from at least 15 years ago.1.

- I was so excited to see this game come out- I loved the Godfather, and From Russia with Love, and the hype surrounding this game was incredible.  The actual game, however, was incredibly disappointing.  The driving controls, especially compared to the driving controls in The Godfather, are AWFUL.  I was having so much trouble driving I kept looking through the handbook to see if I was doing something wrong, but from what I saw I was using the controller the way I was supposed to.  Most of the missions involve driving, under a specific time limit, and with these awful controls, I gave up early- way too frustrating.  The musical play list that you get to control was fun, but I would have liked more free-roaming like in the Godfather.  I was also looking forward to hearing everyone's voices that were in the opening credits- Dale Earnhardt Jr???  But since I have almost totally given up on it now, I guess I won't get to hear their voice acting talent.  Does anyone know if they plan to re-release this on the xbox 360?  Maybe some of the control issues could be worked out before then.  This game had so much potential that right now it is not living up to
+ I don't know how to extoll the praises of this game loudly enough.  We plugged it in on Christmas morning and the entire family and friends have been playing it ever since.  The selection of songs is excellent.  The sing and dance feature brings sends this game WAY out in front of earlier editions (which we also have).  The eye toy is a good addition.  Just everything about it is first rate.  I can't think of a single drawback.  My only suggestion is that you purchase the game and make it an experience for the entire family, PARENTS TOO
- Every year there has to be a game adapted from a classic movie or based on a classic movie (From Russia With Love, which is actually not a bad game.). Recently just landing my hands on a copy of this, I simply couldn't resist picking up SCARFACE: THE WORLD IS YOURS. I loved the movie SCAR FACE, and I was gonna love this.But It turns out I didn't.The controls are really a joke, instead of your normal FPS/3PS/RPG etc, there are really bland controls you can't even tell what to do. The dialogue is corny, and everything else is a joke.For die-hard fans only, I guess
- You get a few outfits and some new furniture but not a lot.  With all of the free stuff out there to download for The Sims, the Stuff Pack is not very worth it.  Maxi is just milking the franchise for every penny
+ This game I would recommend without reservation to anyone looking for an adventure game that is beautiful, positive, entrancing, funny, inventive, has a great soundtrack, and doesn't involve violence / carnage.  I'm 40 and was completely under the spell of the game for weeks and weeks.  My 6 year old son was equally engaged, and was able to complete about 40% of it without help, himself (he needed help with boss battles, or anything under time pressure).You can lose hours to this game but you won't emerge with tense, sore shoulders from anxiety or frustration over impossible tasks.  At the same time, it is definitely not too easy.  It's just challenging enough.  And it's long thank goodness, because I didn't want it to end!  The overall tone is so positive.  You get to be a Japanese wolf goddess romping through what is a detailed, beautifully imagined and executed Japanese watercolor world.  You have weapons and you do take out monsters, but your weapon is a ink brush, and you take out the monsters with calligraphy strokes.  Simply brilliant, and would make an excellent Christmas gift for an adventure game lover
- I noticed there were not many new items in this game, I found this the advertising for this game to be deceiving.  This expansion was not worth the money
- Downloading objects from fan sites can be hit or miss -- I have had many collections I've downloaded work incorrectly or not work at all in the next expansion pack, and items I really liked were suddenly unavailable.  So, I was looking forward to a "Stuff" pack from Maxis.Bah.  Yes, there are several very nice items, but really, this is an underwhelming collection on the whole.  Items are very limited and the collections are small.  The pictures you see on the cover are a good portion of what is contained.  Like so many here remarked, the money spent is not equal to the value received.  Another reviewer pointed out what the title "Glamour Life" implies -- jewelry, house items, luxurious textures for floors and walls, and clothing for all ages, and most of all, excess and abundance.  There's no abundance here.  I've found items I like, but I am not impressed with the collection.Maxis knows that its target audience is always hungry for new items, and I think it is taking advantage of the fact, fooling us into thinking we are getting much more than we actually recieve for our money.  I feel a little cheated.  If you must have this, wait until the price drops, or -- better yet -- find a good, reputable fan site  (there are some very good ones out there that have safe downloads) and download for a small fee or for free
+ I can't get enough of Okami! I've beaten it and am started on a second play-though. Any action-RPG game fan has to at least try this game! The title basically says it all. It is a typically Japanese play on words, since, depending on how you translate it, "Okami" can mean either "wolf" or "king of the gods". For those people to whom that is not enough information to really understand the game, here are the basics:100 years before the game's beginning, a huge 8-headed dragon monster called the Orochi menaced the small village of Kamiki. After suffering Orochi's tyranny for years, the village's champion, Nagi, and a white wolf the village dubbed Shiranui, defeated the Orochi. Shiranui died from his wounds after the fight, and the village built a shrine for him. Peace reigned for 100 years, until the evil suddenly and mysteriously reappeared...You control Shiranui reborn in a quest to save the land from the evil. You travel all over the land of Nippon (which is Japanese for "Japan"; how original) fighting monsters, helping people, and healing nature of the curse of evil. The story is nothing new, and is both very linear and quite predictable. But it is very well done, mixing japanese mythology into a classic hero story, with a generous helping of humor to give it flavor.The story has one major downside, though: it is told through cut scenes that contain bucket-loads of exposition. You will often find yourself button-mashing X desperately to try to speed things along, and that does not work very well because the important cut scenes don't let you speed up the dialogue. For instance, the very first cut scene that opens the game literally takes at least 15 minutes to get through before you can get to the action. Most of the rest are not nearly that long, but several of them do take a good 5 minutes at least. To say that it gets tedious is an understatement.Still, the cell-shaded graphics largely make up for the tedious cut scenes. They are done in a very beautiful, yet simplistic style that evokes a traditional Japanese ink painting. Despite the simple style, though, the level of detail is outstanding. In fact, it is so detailed that there is the occasional spot of graphical slowdown. This game really pushes the hardware of the PS2 to its limits.The music and sound are also fantastic. Most of the music evokes traditional Japanese art as much as the graphics do, while the sound effects range from wolf barks and footfalls to wind blowing gently through trees, and more. The mood is always set perfectly for whatever environment you're visiting.Except, possibly, with the voices. Rather than real voices, people talk in a form of gibberish that sounds like someone trying to talk underwater. While it does not bother me personally, some people simply can not listen to these voice effects. Either you'll hate the voice noises with a passion, or you won't care at all. Either way, this is not a good point for the game.The controls take a bit of getting used to, but when you have gotten used to them they become second nature. Unlike the "Legend of Zelda" games, there is no enemy lock-on during combat. Instead, you automatically target the closest monster(s) when you push the attack button. This simplifies combat without turning it into a button-mashing cake walk. It works perfectly...unless you get hit by the controller bug.Yes, a *bug* in the game. Thankfully rare, as I only encountered it twice in 60+ hours of game play. Still, when it happens it is extremely annoying. During combat, while you're wailing away on a monster, the options-menu will suddenly open for no reason. Usually, the analog control on your controller will also go crazy, either just turning off or madly flickering on and off. Either case makes the game impossible to play, of course, since you control your in-game avatar with the left analog stick. The first case is easy to fix; just turn the analog control back on and exit the menu. In the second case, you can only fix it by literally unplugging the controller and then plugging it back in.Far more common than the controller bug are the load times. They usually are not terrible, but it seems like a loading screen comes up at least every five minutes or so. Between these and the long cut-scenes, you might sometimes wonder if there is actually any game play included.But there *is* game play, and it is a lot of fun. There is a great deal to keep you occupied, from the compelling story line to the many treasure hunts, races, puzzles, and mini-games. Between fighting to save the world, you can go fishing, feed animals, catch thieves, and a lot more. Plus, after you beat the game once it unlocks lots of extras, including image galleries and the sound track. All of that and the wonderful atmosphere definitely make this a game worth checking out. Rent it before you buy it, if possible, to make sure you can deal with the long cut scenes, numerous load times, and weird voice effects. But if you are a fan of action RPGs like "Legend of Zelda", you will definitely want to add Okami to your game library.Summary:Pros:- Great story- Great graphics- Great music/sound- Wonderful atmosphere- Lots of culture and mythology to give it flavor- Plentiful activities and mini-games- Unlockable extras after beating the gameCons:- Occasional graphic slowdown- Too much exposition- Tedious cut-scenes- Lots of load times- Rare controller bugNeutral:- Voice noises that you might or might not hate Over-all score: Five stars of fun-fun-fun!  But three stars over all because of the many problems
+ this is a master piece , its art its beautiful ... where do I start , words don't describe this game .. I love it , the music is wonderful .this game combines all the the good elements in gaming into a single one ( mystical ninja ( music and weirdness ) + zelda perfection ( and I mean that there are no miss able events or items in the game ( although there is only one miss able ???? in the game )) + some dragon ball ideas ( not power ups ) , I played this game for 133 hours ( of course everything is completed )and I'm sorry it ended ( you can finish the game much faster but I tend to enjoy such masterpieces )... RESULT : if you love traditional Japanese music and culture + perfectly programmed games ... then this game is for you 
- This pack offered very little of anything. The decor (very little of it) is uninspired. I was hoping to get some good artwork at least.  I know a lot of people don't like to download from fan sites but don't waste your money on this junk.  Believe me fantasies have much better and more creative stuff for your sims and most of it is free, and none of it cost  as much as this glamour life stuff pack did.  This is the first and last stuff pack that I will ever buy
+ Okami rates among the most beautiful games I've ever seen.  The main point of the game is that you're the reincarnation of a god, awakened after a hundred years to dispatch of the evil that's overtaken the land. The entire landscape is bleak and dead--affected by the evil, and it's your task to both fight the ultimate evil, and restore the land using various techniques you learn throughout the game. One of the really interesting aspects of the game is that, since the main character is folk tale Deity (in the form of a wolf), the player can affect the environment of the game by drawing with a calligraphy brush. A circle stroke in the sky creates a sun to turn night into day. Another stroke across a dead tree brings it bursting into full bloom. A slashing stroke across your enemies cuts them. My only minor complaint so far is that perhaps it does a little too much shepherding in terms of letting you know where to go next. However, this doesn't detract for the game overall. At the same time, the player does have a good deal of freedom--I haven't felt railroaded through the story line at all.  Perhaps the extra guidance will make this game more accessible also for people who aren't usually gamers.  If you're looking for something visually interesting, occasionally humorous, and with very different game-play from the usual fare, Okami is highly recommended. 
- OK, so where the heck is Vince Young, Matt Leinart, and Reggie Bush in this version?  You see Reggie Bush on the cover, so you think you're going to get the opportunity to play with the Heisman Trophy winner, pair him up with Lendale White and Matt Leinart, and take on the Longhorns to try and replay the Rose Bowl.  But none of these players are to be found.  In fact, Ohio State is listed as the #1 team.Am I behind the times?  Or is this how EA Sports does their football games?  Do I need to buy NCAA 06 in order to use these players in their prime?  I was hoping to be able to play them with updated "abilities" that would reflect all of their outstanding years in 2005.Any ideas out there?  Is this a code or a "cheat" I need to unlock?HELP!!
- I was reading that 8000-word review by Dave Jeanclerc, and I strongly disagree with some of his points.  (P.S. My review has nothing to do with the Box 360 version, which, apparently, is awesome.)I HAVE PLAYING THE EA FOOTBALL GAMES SINCE THE MID-90'S, and I'm sick of paying $50 for the same game every year.  EA Games owns the rights to the college and NFL teams, so you won't see any football games by any other game companies, most note ably, SEGA, who revolutionized football simulation games in the late 80's.NCAA Football 07 is basically the same as NCAA Football 2002, and 2003, and 2004, and 05 and 06.  Each year, EA adds a little tweak to the mix, but overall, it's the same look, the same feel, the same moves, the same everything.  This year, they've changed the way you kick the ball, and added more defensive audibles--that's it.  There are a few other minor adjustments, but none are worth noting IMO.  In fact, the audibles they added are the EXACT SAME audibles you used to have on Sega's ESPN Football 2005--you can call audibles for individual defensive players.  Thieves.  Everything else is THE EXACT SAME AS 05 and 06.  The most disappointing thing, graphically speaking, is the crowd...it still looks like flat rows of objects moving in unison, just like it did on games made 10 years ago.OH--one other big change...the "improved" momentum meter.  If you thought it was ridiculous last year, wait til you play NCAA 07.  The "momentum meter" has such a strong influence on the game, that if you make ONE OFFENSIVE MISTAKE in the beginning of the game, you're doomed...that's it.  You can't win.  For example--I played FSU vs. UM twice.  The first time, I made no 1st half errors, and pounded the Hurricanes 31-10.  I played with the same exact settings in the same stadium again, and purposely fumbled the opening kickoff, giving the Hurricanes the ball at my 35 yd. line, and I lost the game 45-24.  That fumble was my ONLY MISTAKE of the game.NESSLER, HERBSTRIET AND CORSO ARE STILL MAKING THE SAME EXACT IN-GAME COMMENTS THEY WERE SAYING IN 05 AND 06...GIMME A BREAK!!!!  Also, the AI is still atrocious.  Defensively, the computer controlled team is hapless.  They blitz on every down.  In fact, I've lined up numerous times for a 3rd and long with 4 or 5 receivers, and the defence continually loads 8 men in the box...they don't even put enough DB's out there to stop me.  It's basically a game of long bombs.  If you choose a team with good receivers, you can easily throw for 400+ yards a game by continually going deep.  THE SAFETIES ALWAYS BLITZ!!!  The safeties only drop back into coverage if you have 3rd and 20+, or 4th and 15+.  So how does the computer counteract your deep balls?  Easy--when the momentum meter swings against your favor, your receivers drop EVERY BALL YOU THROW AT THEM, (even if you hit them in the chest with the ball) and when you finally decide to run the ball, your RUNNING BACK FUMBLES THE BALL IMMEDIATELY.  I played a game between USC and Cal, and I kept switching to play with the team that DIDN'T have the momentum, and I ended up turning the ball over on every possession.You may be reading this and saying, "Hey--this guy has played this game a lot to figure all of this out."  No, not really--it's exactly how I've played the 05 and 06 game, and the same "glitches" I've encountered in them, too.  EA has really dropped the ball again.  You are paying $50 to get updated rosters, and, in typical EA fashion, you don't even have names for any of the players--just different skill levels.EA games suck.  Their soccer games are horrible, their basketball games are too slow and awkward, and they don't update their football games.  I GUARANTEE YOU THAT MADDEN 07 WILL BE THE SAME AS MADDEN 06...JUST WATCH.And by the way--EA has gone all-out on the Box 360 editions of NCAA 07 ans Madden 07...I'm sure those versions will be stunning.  The rest of us are paying the same price for last year's game
- Typical Box game using checkpoints instead of creativity to make it challenging. Nothing more mind numbing than doing the same thing over and over again because you keep getting killed right before the next checkpoint. Granted, you can get hours and hours of playing time from it, but only about 25% is something that you haven't already done 10 times before. I highly recommend this game to people who are of the intellect that enjoy working on production lines where they do same thing repeatedly. If your brain actually requires some kind of stimulation, find a more creative game. In addition, some actions tend to be a bit uncooperative at times, such as when attempting to knock someone out but instead you just stand there waiting to get shot. Apparently if you aren't facing in just the perfect position when attempting smash his brains out, you stand there like a manakin hoping the guy two inches in front of you doesn't notice. Another option is to try and shoot him, but unless you get a head shot, expect to fire of gobs of rounds to take him out since you seem to be armed with what can only be a .22 short pistol
+ When I first looked at this game in the store I wasn't real sure about it.  I was totally surprised when I got it home and tried it out.  It starts out slow but that is only to prepare you for what is to come!  It has the greatest story line and add great graphics, wonderful characters and easy to learn controls.  Put all that together and you have OKAMI!!  I am an avid gamer I love all types but mainly enjoy action/adventure.  I am a 36 year old mother of 4 and I so enjoy sitting down with my kids and kicking their butt (in a game of coarse)we all have so much fun together.  I know that alto of people look down at video games in general but I DO SPEND QUALITY TIME with my kids!  Anyway, this game was an absolute masterpiece!  It had it all!  I have played god Of War, Samari Warriors 1,2 and EX. Legends, Dynasty Warriors, Norrath, Balders Gate just to name a few.  This game was the icing on the cake!  I have never written reviews about any games before but I just couldn't keep from saying something about this game!!  I plan to play it over and over because I know there is plenty more to do in this game that I may have missed the first time.  This game has to be a qualifier for, if not the winner for GAME OF THE YEAR!!!!Respectfully,        Pretty Mam
- nothing more really needs to be said.I'm running a 3GHz P4;256Mb ATI Radeon 9000 series PCI express video card and 2Gb of RAM and the game still hangs,lags and locks up on my computer. I tried uninstallingandreinstalling-same effect.DO NOT BUY THIS GAM
+ With the PS2's life cycle coming to an end, there are hardly any new games that are anything remotely spectacular.  Capcom's Okami however, is just that, and it's not just one of the best games to ever grace the PS2, it's one of the most original games you'll ever play.  The first thing you'll notice about Okami is the game's incredibly unique art style and graphics, which are some of the best to ever grace the PS2.  Seriously, this game looks incredible, you won't believe your eyes.  Okami's story line is based on Japanese legend dealing with the sun god Amaterasu, who you play as in the form of a white wolf, and the epic quest that awaits him.  Now, what truly sets Okami apart from the rest of the pack is the calligraphy-esque celestial brush that you must use to advance throughout the game.  Need a bridge?  Draw it.  Need to dispatch a pesky enemy?  Draw him in half.  This brush adds a new dynamic to the game-play which is fresh and unique, and makes you wonder why no one has ever tried anything like it before in a game of this type.  There's loads of side quests and mini-games as well, adding to the length of Okami which truly make it an epic game, and all of which help make this one of the best games ever on the PS2.  If there's anything bad to say about Okami, it's that the combat can get too easy at spots, but that is only an extremely minor gripe.  All in all, Okami is just the thing that PS2 owners have been waiting and yearning for.  An original, epic adventure that doesn't get stale and provides some of the most unique and mouth watering graphics you'll ever see.  If you own a PS2, Okami is an absolute must own, and it's one of the best games you'll ever play
-   The overall impression is that of a game made on the rush.Assuming the "good" alignment, you win simply by building expensive  buildings at the edge of your influence zone and burning the enemy's platoons sent by a very unintelligent AI. Since winning requires no strategy, the game is challenging; you can do basically the same on all levels.    The races against which one fights are pretty much the same except for their "skins" and the building's aspect. Defeating them all takes you at most 8 hours of game-play.   Unlike the previous version of B&W, there are no custom campaigns nor multi player features. Cinematics and creature apart, it looks like a very primitive first version of "Age of Empires".         
- The game itself is very interesting - the story line is engaging and the controls are unique.  It's an RPG, which is quite a switch for Mario.  The major problem with this game is interactivity - not enough of it.  Specifically, there are far too many cut scenes that are not stoppable.  Many of these cut scenes lead directly into a boss battle.  The most frustrating instance of this is just before the final boss battle - it takes about 10 minutes to get to the "real" fight from the prior save point.  This isn't a problem for the first time through the sequence, but if you lose 4 or 5 times, this just becomes a hassle and makes the game not really worth playing to see the end.  This is a major problem that most game designers have found work-around for, but Nintendo revealed its lack of RPG experience in this element.  It's an interesting game, but just make sure to win, or have a friend/sibling/(enemy?) skip through the dialog sequences for you if you get tired of them
- All I have to say is this game is not for 'EVERYONE'!! you have to be able to READ to play! Last time I checked not everyone can read. I bought this for my 13 year old son...who has autism. He can master just about every game I get him but he can't read. So, for him this game was not much fun. I ended up playing more than he did and I didn't even enjoy it
- with games such as Grand theft auto: San Andreas, drive3r,true crime, etc. the competition is fierce and a game like this won't cut it. first when max talks it sounds like he is mumbling second the graphics suck third the game just sucks in general I am so glad I got this used for $6 I bet it was returned because it was too dumb for the previous owner. I saw it at EB games for only $5 that must mean it sucks and I read rockstar game the rights to remedy because the sales for the sequel max payne 2 were so low I have no clue how this was made a "greatest hit" play GTA or true crime ins tea
- I had high hopes on this game but I was disappointed. The controls are horrible and definitely the voice acting throughout 90% was bad. The story line was basically typical, it really didn't hold my interest for long. I did beat the game because I spent $50 on it the day it came out and I figured I would at least do that. I gave the game to a friend of mine after I beat it and he had the same opinion as I did. It's worth renting but definitely not worth buying. Hopefully those who decide to buy or rent this game can devote a good bit of time trying to learn the controls
- this game is just a waste of time everything about this crap game gave me a huge headache think god for advil they said that it took then a long time to make this game and for what its not worth nothing cameras are very bad it makes you dizzy when you play it there also a part in this game were you have to follow a maze in pitch dark all you see is the lines from the maze you fall off almost every time plus that baby crying too just does it help you. like I said just a waste of time. plus max payne looks funny in this game take a good look at his face it looks like he from resident evil the walking dead. and they said it took then a long time to make this game. this game should have never been release
- this game is really bad I mean everything about it. they took so long to make this and for what.its just a waste off time and your money I gave it 1star because the guns are the best thing about this crap gam
- Being a Star sky and Hutch fan since I was a kid, I was looking forward to playing this. The graphics are "cartoon" horrible and the need for "VR" points becomes annoying after awhile. The bad guys are like something from a Chinese Kung Fu movie, you can shoot at them accurately and it takes all day to kill them...and that's with playing with a PS2 gun (I can't imagine shooting with a controller) which makes you lose the mission because you are down on "VR" points. The dialog gets annoying too and you can't skip hearing it either
- This game has a great design and excellent/fun story BUT it was obviously not fully tested before it was released for the PC. Whenever there are more than about 5 enemies on the screen the game has horrible clipping/graphic slowdown issues. This means the bad guys keep shooting but your guy doesn't respond quickly to the commands. The clipping is so bad that sometimes I just wanted to find the CEO of Activision and shove this game down his throat. This CAN be a fun game, just don't play the PC version. Borrow someone's Box and play that version. This is another example of a greedy developer rushing a PC port to market without bothering to make sure it worked right
+ Rock star games  are rocking the gamers world,one more of the great titles from the leaders in adult games
+ I have all the "Grand Theft" games and this is one of my favs.I highly recommend it and all the others.I recently purchased "Liberty City" Awesome
+ The best way to play this game is to skip the missions and just start havoc in the city.  Fight the gangs and police, attack the citizens and steal cars!!  If you are able to find some of the cheat codes off the Internet, then this is where the fun really begins! These secrets can give you armour, weapons and even a tank (this is only listing a few)!  As always parents, research a video game before you buy it for your 7 year old.  
- I thou gt there would be a better story line, and what I found was very disappointing.The boss (McGruder) was easier to beat than the boss in the Matrix-Path to neo. I mean, I paid good money for this game on the premise that it was a quality game; obviously I was wrong
- Don't buy this here - it is selling for $49.99 at Best Buy (bestbuy.com). Wait until they lower the price on Amazon
- I rented this game for my 3 year old.  Who loves the movie.  He tried to play it.  He like it.  I tried to play it and got to the dancing part.  I couldn't get past it.  I tried for 5 days.  My rental time was up.  I returned it.  I haven't rented it since.  This game is way too hard to beat.  And my 3 year old got bored with it real fast.  I would NOT recommend this game to anyone.  Don't waste your money buying it.  Unless you are an expert with video games.  I'm just thankful that I rented it instead of buying it
+ Fable is easily one of the greatest games to ever be released. The story of a boy who grows up to become a hero and still wants revenge for the tragedy of his past, it is compelling and very entertaining. The game-play  is excellent, it's not your typical RPG since this plays like an action/adventure game. I love how you can choose to be good or bad and the choices you make reflect on what your character looks like. The game also plays like real life. You can get married, divorced, have sex and buy houses, even decorate them! The game is so real that you can choose to be straight, gay or bi-sexual depending on who you sleep with. The only thing that is missing is that you can't have children, but that should change in future installments. Another cool thing about the game is that the more evil you get, the more people are afraid of you. But, the more of a hero and savior you become, you are greeted with praise and clapping in every town you go to. Overall, this game is a MUST HAVE!!! The replay value is extremely high. I have played and beat the game many times and I'm still not tired of it! If you love RPGs or hate RPGs this is still fantastic. I can't wait until Fable 2 is released, which is currently being completed. Get this, it is simply amazing!
- I rented this game and returned it the next day because between my and my friend we could not get past the dancing scene we tried for like an hour and couldn't get past it don't waste your time or patience with this annoying game
- Pointless quests with no real conclusions. CTD every 30-45 minutes. Lengthy dialogue with no real human attachment. All in all a VERY unpolished product, even with the patch. If your favourite aspect of the first game was the story then do not buy this game
- Such great visuals and I love most of the Star Wars RPG/Shooters, BUT, I cant believe this is a point and click game.  I was hoping KOTOR2 would have implemented a normal battle engagement.  There's nothing worse than toggling through menus etc during an intense battle and actually having to turn around, click the target, then engage someone else after the kill.  The days of Boulder's Gate point-n-click should be over, but I guess There's a crowd for this type of game-play.  Still a good game, but disappointed
- Lucas should be ashamed to stamp his name on this turkey. do not play on the box 360. you will experience random sound shrieks, resolution issues, too-Long load times. and overall this is a really buggy and perplexing product. why? the first was very good
- I BOUGHT THIS GAME WHEN IT WAS $50 BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT GAME. I WAS WRONG. YOU DON'T GET A LIGHT SABRE UNTIL FAR INTO THE GAME AND ALL THE ADVERTISEMENTS SHOWS YOU WITH A LIGHT SABRE. THE GAME IS EXTREMELY BUGGY AND HAS POOR GRAPHICS. I AM A HUGE STAR WARS FAN AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE NO MATTER HOW BIG OF A STAR WARS FAN THEY ARE.                     DON'T BUY THIS GAME
- First off I just want to say that I've read "The Secret of the Old Clock" and it made this game even more boring because I knew the basic outline.I see in an above review an adult of the age 35 loved it, which I can understand. But I'm 15 and I found this game OVERLY boring. The puzzles were way too easy, and driving around in the horribly done car part of the game made me want to quit playing. It says you'll get a pay if you do some chores for people...I didn't get anything. Although I love her interactive and and I love all the other Nancy drew games I would highly recommend you don't waste $19.00 on it. I would only recommend getting it if it was in a value pack of Nancy Drew games
- I was excited to play this game because I wanted to play a detective-like game.  unfortunately, this game is very kid-like.  here's an example.  the first non auto-generated task is to solve some puzzles for a guy.  these are the simple kind of puzzles you could find in a children's word game book.  I easily got all of them except 1, meaning I couldn't progress past this point.  no problem for me, because by this time I didn't want to!  I'm not saying it's a bad game, it's just probably not a good game for grownups.
+ This game was a new experience for me I didn't think I would like it but I did, I like the story telling and it keeps you interested overall , interesting, fun, and it will entertain you...
- Sure, the graphics and sound ARE nice, but this game is very linear and very forgiving- too forgiving. You can save and reload just about constantly, so long as there aren't monsters nearby and things are made kinda dummy-proof so you can't make any significant mistakes. As a result, I never really felt like I was taking much of a chance doing anything. The dialogue is mostly a matter of clicking responses until you can't click anymore and there's not much bad consequence to clicking them in any ol' order. There's really only one path through the different areas of the game and nothing ever re spawns. You can also adjust the difficulty levels from very easy to very difficult but the experience and treasure don't adjust accordingly. This means if a fight is too tough after a couple reloads you can make it very easy and still get the same rewards you would have gotten when it was hard. <yawn> Maybe I'm just a little jaded from playing online games like Ever quest for so long. In online, real time games with other humans playing around you there is much more of an unpredictable, and more importantly uncontrollable, and much more exciting environment to play in. I got so bored with this that I actually stopped playing while close to completing the very last area of the game. I just didn't care anymore. This game requires very little thinking or stargazing
- On paper, the idea of a 24 video game sounds like a great idea, and upon first glance of it, it seems like it's firing on all cylinders.  Featuring all the major players from the series reprising their roles (Kiefer Sutherland, Dennis Haysbert, Elisa Cuthbert, etc.) and a storyline and tone and atmosphere that captures the feel of the show, 24: The Game falls apart once you get further into it.  The missions are repetitive, the animation and graphics are jumpy and glitched, and the controls are unresponsive to say the least.  Targeting enemies is a chore at times as you use the analog sticks, but the targeting along with just plain moving gets incredibly cumbersome thanks to a camera that seems to want to work against you.  Some of this could be forgive able, but the further you get through 24 the more rushed the game feels.  It's a shame too, considering how innovative the series was in it's early life and everything the game had going for it.  If more polish was put into it, 24: The Game could have been something special, but as it is, it's only recommended as a rental for fans of the series
- I guess the first thing I'll say is that I got Jedi Academy BEFORE I got this game. I was HUGELY disappointed. I really liked Jedi Academy but this game is not that great. I have cheat codes so I can have all weapons and all ammo and I can be undying. There are part's in this game that are INSANELY tough. There are way to many puzzles - I don't mind puzzles but there are simply way to many. And some on them are insanely hard. I would recommend you to get Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy - way better the puzzles aren't insane and you get to choose what you look like and....well I could go on but I'll leave it there. If you aired have Jedi Academy and you want another star wars game that is $20 then you sold get Battlefront thats another great game. Just don't get this game.
- I used my remote all of about 8 times before it stopped working.  Even with the proprietary dongle inserted into a controller slot you cannot control this thing with a controller, you must use the remote control.  When you take the dongle out with a DVD in, a screen will come up telling to reinsert, so if either the dongle or the remote get slightly injured or malfunction, then you've just wasted thirty bucks.  I feel quite ripped off.  With the low cost of DVD nowadays, it's a MUCH better idea to buy a standalone IMHO, you can get a good progressive scan for about $30 or $40, which comes out to about the same price.As a side, it is also EXTREMELY annoying that you can't turn on, or off the device with the remote, you must go up to box to do it yourself, especially annoying if you just want to watch a DVD in your bed and crash afterwards.  All in all the value proposition offered by this product is very low considering the similarly priced alternatives
+ I really, really enjoyed this game.  It was the only game I played for almost 2 months, I was so hooked on it.  My only criticism is that the missions are too rigid, so the outcomes are very much the same during re-play, even if you make different choices.  I thought it was really neat that the character changes according to what you do - e.g. too much eating, and he gets fat.
+ This is my second PS2. I traded my first on in on a Box 360, which only  lasted 91 days before it died (read all about it in my 360 review). Leary of version 1.0 PS3, I opted to go back to the PS2 and its proven reliability and copious games for less money. I got a set of HDTV cables, a wireless controller, and have not looked back. What a fool I was to fall for Micro scams empty promises! This is the best game system! You can even play online for free! The games are more challenging and last a lot longer than the 360 games ,which I could beat in a week, playing an hour a day. The warranty is awesome at 1 year parts and labor! I am not worried,however, because I had my original PS2 for 10 years without issue before trade-in! A fantastic system at an unbeatable price! I will keep this one for at least a year before trading it in on a PS3 ,once all of the bugs are fixed and the price goes down to $400..........Until then, long live the PS2!!!
- David's which play perfectly well on other cheap players, freeze/skip or don't play when I try to play them on the BOX. Don't waste your money on this, buy a stand-alone DVD player instead so you won't have the frustration that I've had
+ You can go wrong, very good equipment, lots of fun easy to carry, the console with most games plus has a great Price
+ First off the eye toy is a great game/peripheral. Next it's getting some new games, as well as it will be use able on the next gen console PS3. Third it is usable as a web cam on the PC. In fact, it is a fantastic web cam. Only you need to download a .inf (a driver) for the web cam. There's tutorials out there. Google it
+ You can read that the Eye toy is a great "toy" in other reviews, but I just wanted to say that you can use it as a web cam on your PC by just plugging it into your computer's USB port
- This remote is of awful quality; I've been through two of them in the past year. I wouldn't complain so much if it didn't cost $30! It's worth ten, at most. Most people would be better off buying a cheap DVD player, rather than using the box
- The game seemed to start off like any other Nancy Drew game.  My daughter has played them all.  However, after a while, it seemed as throw it was an Easter egg hunt for three year old.  Everything was easy to find and not mysterious at all.  All the other games took my daughter quite some time before she figured out the mystery.  However, this game took her two days.  All the other Nancy Drew games kept her intrigued and kept her coming back for more.  This game breezed by and and she was quite disappointed.  In fact, her words at the end of the game were, "that's it?".  Her interactive, better come out with a more interesting game next time or you'll lose the interest
- Seems like they just hurried this game. Too much running around to get answers. The phone did not even have web access. Actually I did not like it at all
- My daughter and I have played all of the previous games; we've enjoyed them overall.  Some of the games are fantastic, challenging and fun. This game was quite lame in comparison to the others.  The puzzles weren't really puzzling, just boring tasks.  There were not many clues to find.  Because there weren't many clues, there was no real sense of detecting anything.  The game ended abruptly and was very short.  We did NOT use a walk-through to solve the mystery in record time, just experienced a lack of challenge.  We did like the newness of becoming Frank and Joe Hardy occasionally.  The rest was pretty boring.  If you are looking for a Nancy Drew game, try one of the others instead
- The review by Bovey is spot-on!  These games have gotten more boring as they go.  The majority of this game is spent looking for the same shells over and over to make the same necklaces over and over....how much is enough?  There was no real sense of scariness or danger... just boredom! And the game was so short... suddenly it ended!  I am so disappointed in what these games have become.  I loved The Final Scene, I even liked Blackmoor Manor even though I could never have finished it without consulting a walk through.  This game was just lame. I don't recommend paying full price for it
+ Seriously. You could just hold up a finger close to the camera lens and just wave it back and forth. That is a perfect way of cheating. The game is not bad after all.
- I've been a fan of these games since the first one - Secrets Can Kill - came out.  I've played them all.I'm not at all sure what's happened to the games, though.  While the graphics have steadily improved, the puzzles, plot, and game-play have really gone downhill.  The first game, "Secrets Can Kill" had pretty horrific graphics, but the story was compelling and there were some fabulous puzzles in it.  Things really picked up with the second game, "Stay Tuned for Danger".  Better graphics and a very interesting story, very cool puzzles, great plot.  I can absolutely recommend Games 2 (Stay Tuned for Danger), 3 (Message in a Haunted Mansion), 4 (Treasure in the Royal Tower), 5 (The Final Scene), 6 (Secret of the Scarlet Hand), 7 (Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake), 9 (Danger on Deception Island), and 10 (Secret of Shadow Ranch).These games are similar in length and have interesting puzzles.  Lots of areas where you can snoop around - which I really enjoy.  Game #8 (The Haunted Carousel) is interesting and has wonderful graphics, but is awfully short.  I did not at all enjoy #11 (Curse of Blackmoor Manor) as I found it way too difficult.   I also cannot really recommend #12 (Secret of the Old Clock). It was too short and repetitive.  I did somewhat enjoy #13 (Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon) and #14 (Danger by Design) but they were nowhere near the quality of the earlier games in terms of plot or puzzles.And now, we have #15.  Outstanding graphics, but way too short.  The amount of repetition of puzzles in order to advance drove me completely crazy.  I don't mind Nancy running about doing errands to help people (for that, I thought Games 3 and 4 had it perfectly balanced).  But I like each task to be different and interesting.  Not mind-numbingly repetitive and boring.  This seems to be a factor of the more recent games - delivering telegrams in Game #12, painting pictures in Game #14, and now finding seashells and making necklaces in this game.  I miss looking for clues.  Putting together evidence for a purpose.  I miss puzzles that actually are woven into the fabric of the plot and are there to advance the game.  It seems like the repetition now might be so that it can be said that this game took X number of hours to complete.  I also miss learning useful things.In #1, I learned about American Sign Language In #3, I learned about Chinese symbols and the San Francisco earthquake In #4, I learned about latitude and longitude and how a sextant works In #6, I learned SO much about the Maya and how to work a HAM radio In #7, I learned about Roman Numerals and Prohibition In #8, I learned how to make invisible writing!In #9, I learned how to work a HAM radio and about Pacific Northwest sea animals After that, well, I didn't really learn very much of anything useful in any of the later games.  If you've never played a Nancy Drew game, please, please, PLEASE do yourself a favor and start with one of the earlier games (although probably not the very first one - the graphics aren't as good and switching discs can be highly annoying).  But give #2 - 9 a try; you won't be disappointed!Oh please, Her Interactive, PLEASE go back to the way they used to be structured.  I'd gladly sacrifice some of the improved graphics if it meant regaining some plot, cohesion, or integrated, interesting puzzles.
+ We got a group of 5 friends together to do Guitar Hero 1 and 2, DDR, and now Karaoke Revolution Party. It's freaking cool. The songs list is very good and there's something for everyone. Easy to figure out too
+ Karaoke Revolution Party is a fantastic game with great songs, great easy game-play and perfect party game features. If you've never tried a karaoke game, now's the time to play.First, the basic setup. You get to FULLY customize your character. We're talking black, white, male, female, heavy, skinny, athletic. Then you go for hair styles, hair colors, outfits down to the shoes and jewelry. You can every use your Eye Toy to scan your FACE onto the face of the character. It is simply amazing.Then we go onto the song list. I own probably every karaoke game out for the 3 main systems. I love karaoke games. This song list is by far my favourite song list of all time - and it's true for my boyfriend as well. There are a good mix of jumping songs, slow romantic songs, rocking songs and more. In other karaoke games you have to go through unlocking the venues and songs. Because this is a party game, they pretty much give you everything up front, with a few exceptions. You do unlock a few songs and a ton of characters / outfits as you go, to keep things interesting. A few standouts include the Elvis outfit and the cat outfit.In addition to being able to sing along in both single player and duet modes, there are a bunch of fun mini-games. You can compete against other players, try to play note-matching games and even set up the eye toy so you see your own background in the game. Even better, if you have a dance pad, you can sing and dance at the same time! This is REALLY great for building up your vocal powers. Many people can sing fine if they stand still like a stick, but when you sing in a band you're actually expected to move around and dance. Using the dance pad helps you build up your lung power and timing so that you get those skills. Even if you're not in a band, you can see the challenges that your favourite singers face.This game is a TON of fun both with friends in party mode, or just singing along yourself with the songs. Where some of the previous versions of karaoke sometimes had "questionable" versions of songs, with them being obviously different from the original, these songs are great sounding and many times I didn't have to look at the song bar at all to sing along with them.Highly, highly recommended!!Rating: 5/5NOTE: The previous reviewer says this has the Area Franklin version of Natural Woman. I'm rather sure it's the Carole King version
- Both this game and Danger by Design were disappointing compared to some of the previous games (Shadow Ranch, the Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon, Secret of the Old Clock, etc.).  The game was short, and I thought the tasks were a bit dull.  I also found it somewhat confusing switching between Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys.  Hopefully Her Interactive will produce something better next time, because these games really are addictive, even for adults
+ + 1-8 Players+ Now has 50 songs + You can design and create your own characters or choose from old favorites + Eye Toy lets you put yourself into the game + Duets + Option of using a dance pad and incorporating Dance Dance Revolution along with the singing + Gold, Platinum and Diamond (perfect score) rankings + 69 items to unlock - and you can access the unlocking status to see what it takes to progress + They've gotten rid of the solo challenge section (which is where you had to unlock most of the items in the past) + Games modes: - Quick play - one player version - Arcade - the player with the highest score wins - Medley - sing short clip versions of 3-5 songs all in a row - Sing and Dance - Minigames - KR Challenge - variety of game modes - Duets - Duets Medley - Knock out - Out sing your opponent to knock them out of the game - Knock out Medley - Sing off - 2 players alternate lines to get the highest score + Demo of DDR Extreme that has 3 songs to choose from I have loved Karaoke revolution from the beginning. I didn't think it could be any better than the 3rd version when they added the duets. This version takes the game to a whole new level. There is a wide variety of songs, so many different types of people can play. There are several songs that begin locked, but it didn't take too long to get them unlocked. The mini games are terrible and there was no need for them on the disk. I found that it is near impossible to both sing and dance at the same time. If you don't know all the words to a song, it is impossible to read the singing and dance lines at the same time. Besides, it's extremely difficult to speak, much less sing while exerting yourself on the dance pad. I recommend having one person sing and another dance. This changes it up and gives you some great songs to dance to. I like the DDR games, but never have been crazy about the songs, so I really like the great songs. Here is a complete list of the songs on the game as well as the artist of the version of the song: Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing - Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell Ain't Too Proud to Beg - The Temptations Always - Atlantic Starr American Woman - Lenny Kravitz Brick House - The Commodores Call Me - Blondie Crazy - Aerosmith Crazy in Love - Beyonce Do You Really Want To Hurt Me - Culture Club Drive - Incubis Dust in the Wind - Kansas Endless Love - Lionel Richie and Diana Ross Every Little Thing She Does is Magic - The Police Everybody Wants to Rule the World - Tears for Fears Everywhere - Michelle Branch and Santana Fame - Irene Cara (from the soundtrack) Fly - Hilary Duff For You I Will - Monica Greatest Love of All - Whitney Houston Headstrong - Trapt Here I Go Again - Whitesnake I Don't Want to be - Gavin DeGraw (I've Had) The Time of My Life - Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes (Dirty Dancing soundtrack) I Left My Heart in San Francisco - Tony Bennett I Love Rock and Roll - Joan Jett I Will Always Love You - Whitney Houston If You Could Only See - Tonic I'll Be - Edwin McCain Material Girl - Madonna Me and Bobby McGee - Janis Joplin Pain - Jimmy Eat World Pieces of Me - Ashley Simpson Play That Funky Music - Wild Cherry Start Me Up - The Rolling Stones Superstition - Stevie Wonder Sweet Caroline - Neil Diamond Takin' Care of Business - Bachman-Turner Overdrive Take On Me - A-Ha That's Amore - Dean Martin The Game of Love - Michelle Branch Time After Time - Cyndi Lauper Truth Is - Fantasia Barrino Turn the Beat Around - Gloria Estefan Unforgettable - Nat King Cole Uptown Girl - Billy Joel Waiting for a Girl Like You - Foreigner What I Like About You - Romantics Who Can It Be Now - Men at Work You're My Best Friend - Queen (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman - Aretha Franklin Final Verdit: Run don't walk to buy Karaoke Revolution Party! 
- this game has a 25 minute introduction or story.  Square Enix was really creative and the stories are so good!  However I do expect them to put something like "Skip Intro" cause impatient people could really get mad at the stories!  I, however only get a game every five months so I am fine with that.  This is only a minor flaw.  Another flaw is that when you want to look at the map or statistics, you have to wait 5 seconds until it appears.  Very annoying, but again a minor flaw.  This game depends on how much you like to battle the same creatures over and over and over again!  It get very boring after awhile.  You have to train those dumb spirits and sometimes you just want them to level up quicker.  This game gets very boring after awhile and you will want to ditch the game as well as the characters.  There is not much action and you have a limited amount of monsters to battle.  1.0 ~ 3.5----- terrible3.6 ~ 5-----bad5.1 ~ 6.5-----average6.6 ~ 8-------good8.1 ~ 9------great9.1 ~10------must buy excellent! graphics- 9/10  great sound-9/10 some voice acting but great fun   -   5/10  depends on how patient you are and how you react to battling the same monster over and over again average- about 8 my grade-   7   goo
- I had read pretty good reviews about this game so I bought it.   I was hoping for something with a little action with an interesting storyline.  What I got was probably the most boring game I have ever played.- The introduction/prolouge lasts about 7 minutes or so, including the credits.  You cannot break out and move on- After you set down your PSP and grab a drink, you come back and find that there is one short battle for you to play.  Then you go back to the "story".  The characters have long, annoying conversations and you get to press "X" at the end of each of their sentances.  Again, no way to break out, no in-game menu for you to manage the game.  You have to go through each painfully slow dialog box until the "chapter" is over.This game is really bad.  Maybe it gets a little more interesting; it is possible that there is actually something for you to do besides watch the characters argue.  It is really slow and it is all about the storyline and the dialog.  There does not appear to be any Foreplay.  If you have played this type of game before and you enjoy that style of play, then you might like it.  I was bored and frustrated from the first minute
- Pretty much sums up how I felt after 15 minutes of introductory waffle, hellishly annoying bingy bongy music and (admittedly very pretty) cut scenes, totally emotionless voice overs, impossibly slow conversations that served little or no point.And to be honest at that point it was either switch off the psp or throw it against a wall. I decided to switch it off. Now I'm a big fan of adventure games, played untold legends 1 till it gave up on me (literally left hanging around with nothing to do and no more quests on offer). From what I can gather, the in game graphics for Valkyrie (after 15 minutes [though it seemed like much longer]) I'd seen some really cool character graphics - bit like taken DR in-game graphics - and some of those horrible 2d munchkin Japanese RPG graphics, which are the in-game stuff.So the bit you play looks like it's 20 years old and should be on a gab, the cut scenes are nice but there will no doubt be far too many of those - IE: 5 minutes of slow cut scenes for every encounter.I can't say this is a proper review as I couldn't stand this title long enough to get to any actual game-play and there's no way I'm sitting through that intro again.My advice, if you like the long winded old style walk-and-talk for three hours before actually doing anything, Japanese RPGs. Get this (or better still go to an antiques shop and find an old text adventure). If you prefer a game where you actually play the character and do stuff - avoid this like the plague.I've got high hopes for dungeon siege when it comes out (but then I had high hopes for Valkyrie too :-( ), but for now untold legends 2 is okay, not as good as it should have been but a helluva lot more fun than Valkyrie. I would like to point out that I've never played on a PS2, box or game cube - so this is the first time I've seen a Valkyrie profile game. I didn't have any preconceptions, obviously if I had I'd never have gone anywhere near this title in the first place :-)
+ Lemony the game is not for hardcore gamers. It doesn't aspire to be.  It shouldn't be compared to Warcraft or Resident Evil 4.  The game was developed by AMAZE for Activision.  Any one familiar with the first three Harry Potter Movie co-ordinates games (through Electronic Arts EA Games) is familiar with Amaze. The first three Potter games were fun and a bit of challenge for children and for those adults who were new to PC gaming.  The player wandered around the magical world of Hogwarts, collecting jelly beans and wizard cards.  What was fun was not completing the tasks or learning new magic, what was fun was the freedom to discover new areas and find secret places. Fans of the Potter games will recognize the same mechanics of game-play outfitted  in  a new location, jelly beans are replaced with golden eyes, golden hearts refuel stamina instead of chocolate frogs, playbills and letters are granted instead of wizard cards.  Players will also recognize the flavor of  wonderful score the game is set to, enjoyable, appropriate, but not overbearing with some familiar notes. Lemony isn't quite as good as the aforementioned Potter games. The reason being Lemony is not a fun story. While fictitious, Lemony is a story of the relentless abuse of three very droll and very wealthy orphans. Its much more fun to play as a boy, who has left his abusive Aunt and Uncle behind, entering a magical world to be educated at Hogwarts.  I rather enjoyed learning to how to fly Buckbeak in Prisoner of Exurban. In Lemony, I'm rather relieved I solved the train signal puzzle, the thought of having children run over and over and over by a train until I did, was depressing me. Yet, Lemony will provide some consolation to those who have been disappointed by EA's latest Potter offering, The Goblet of Fire.  While there is an adjustment to the droll circumstances, the task of discovering your world will take over and the game will eventually command your attention. While Lemony isn't bad, it isn't that good, either. They renderings of the children are not the most flattering they could be, and the villains are boorishly ugly.      The game-play controls aren't half as good as the Potter games, and they weren't the greatest. There's a match game puzzle in a cellar, that only shows up per every install, instead of every game. I did complete it and nothing happened on my game, which maybe the reason the puzzle won't show up in the rest of the games in a particular installation.  It has done this twice on me, and I'm not going to uninstall and install a third time to see if it happens again. It had no effect on my score or letter or eye collecting.  The camera angles aren't well mapped for shooting.  I was supposed to shoot a rat, but the camera got behind a ceiling lamp, and while the rat was biting me, all I could see was the inside of a lamp shade. Scuff like that.      Still its better than most children's games out there, and it plays!  As you may have guessed, there is violence.  When I shoot  a rat in Lemony, it is shot with a rotten egg lobber. Rotten eggs are your bullets, and the player stuns the enemies, instead of killing them.  About time.  I've played Lemony three times, the third time it was going through the motions.  Once the few skills of jumping, aiming the egg lobber, and  the boot puncher had been mastered, there wasn't any interest left. But for the time I did play, I did enjoy it. The games by AMAZE are a category unto themselves. They are not action games based on a trigger finger, nor are they the point click boring adventure games beset with brain teaser puzzles in a futuristic world. They are a relaxing time where you don't have to test your brain, just delight it. If you have never played the Potter games and are new to PC gaming I recommend Lemony, it is a good place to start.  If you are a fellow Potterhead and felt betrayed buy Goblet of Fire, Lemony will sustain you.
+ The memory cards came exactly as advertised and they worked great. No read errors, VERY noticeable increased speed of load time compared to other card types..would recommend to anyone looking for a value pack of memory cards because this was well worth it
- I love the idea behind this game and it's pretty impressively executed. I had three gripes though: 1) It's so fast paced that I found it really difficult to progress past the third procedure. 2)I couldn't get the magnify and reduce (with quick little circles) to work.  This caused me great frustration. 3)There's no way to skip through the seemingly endless pages of character dialogue if you have to repeat a procedure a couple of times.I quit playing it pretty quickly
+ I love it that card my children's have one for your own games...
+ I had purchased this two pack memory card and they are pretty good no problems with memory card
+ These are the best memory cards you can get for the PS2.  Only get this one or the Sony PlayStation 2 1PK Memory Card.  Rumors spread that non-Sony memory cards can damage your PS2 and lose saves on you memory cards
+ WOW!!!  This game is so freaking cool!!!  The colossi are amazing!  I've played my share of games, and I can honestly say that I've never encountered creatures like these before.  I'm only about halfway through the game, (having slain 7 colossi with 9 more yet to go), and yet each new colossus that I meet astounds me all over again.  One thing about them, that I have never felt in other games, is that they invoke sympathy towards them.  Until you find them in their own little area of their world, they are just giant hulks resting peacefully, bothering no one. But once disturbed, they awaken, and you must figure out how to take each one down. I actually feel sad when they fall. Supposedly your character must take them down to resurrect his lifeless lover, however I get a sense that there will be a twist to this story before it ends.Another equally awe-inspiring aspect of this game is the environment in which you are playing.  It is without compare the most beautiful, mystical, unbelievably gorgeous landscape I've seen in any game, ever. The world looks, feels, and sounds like an ancient place and time.  You just have to experience it.  This will be one of those games I'll remember years from today and will have to play all over again.  This game is a work of art, just as certain films are; plus it's just so freaking cool!!!  Don't miss it
- This game is mind numbingly hard not because its a very challenging but rather its set up to fail.Most missions thrust you into a situation with little indication of what to do. As the patients vital signs drops, you frantically poke at your DS trying to think on what to do. The nurse, who assists you, gives you vague ideas on how and before you know it you've failed the mission. It would take me an average of 10-15 failures before I finally won a mission. The last mission I played that made me quit, resulted in 30+ failures. And that's only being 1 hour and half into the game. The graphics are crisp and clear. The storyline didn't make much of an impression on me. But I was probably too frustrated to pay attention to that. This game had a lot of potently but killed it by constantly making you fail. Do not buy this game unless you have an extreme amount of patients, game collector who will keep it sealed, or you're a gultton for punishment. Whatever you do, do not buy this game for the hype. It does not live up to it. 
+ This game has stunning graphics and fast-paced game-play. This game is simply killing different bosses over and over again, but don't think mi trying to make this game sound bad because that kind of battles in a game like that make this game how awesome it is. For example every colossus is different looking and has different ways to kill each of them. Some a lot more complicating than others. And threes OS many colossus' that it takes a long time to beat them all. So overall this game is great
- To me, this game was seriously disappointing. So disappointing, I didn't finish the second case before setting it down forever. I was highly entertained - at first. It's cute, funny, and going around clicking on things for a new DS user was highly entertaining. However, it quickly got older. 1. You can't skip through the horrendously long dialog - ever. Even after you've heard it about a million times because you're clicking on people hopelessly in frustration unable to figure out what to do.2. I found myself looking for an internet walk through, yes, on this simplistic game. I couldn't figure out what to click and wandering around hopelessly for thirty minutes reading over dialog you've read a thousand times just gets too frustrating even for my typical patience level.3. Possible Spoiler - There seemed to be a glitch in the second story in which I talked to the wrong person at the wrong time and then I could never get a ticket into the planetarium. After that, I just couldn't take it any more and gave up.4. The places and people never change. For each case, from my understanding, it's all the exact same tiny few places. I'm not a big gamer, but I like a world bigger than three feet. I let a friend borrow it and thus far she is enjoying it more than me. Just to help this review - I'm a college-age female and this is my first gaming console, although I've played the PS2 quite a bit. Maybe it's really a hit or miss but I don't really recommend it for anyone but someone with a high patience level. A REALLY high patience level
+ Pros: *	Awesome graphics*	Huge world to explore*	Great story line*	Easy to play*	You could to kill colossal enemies Cons:*	All you do is kill the 16 Colossi. There are no real side quests except to get power ups and replay to try the Battle attack.
+ Icon was a game that was very different from others. It focused on puzzle solving and had a short but unforgettable story mixed with fantastic visuals and audio. Imagine what Icon would be if action were incorporated into it, you would have something like Shadow of the Colossus, Eco's prequel. SoTC is a colossal achievement on many different levels.Presentation: You stand in front of a deceased woman whose identity  is unknown and are told that by defeating 16 colossi that roam the land, you may be able to revive her...but it may come at a price! This sets up the shroud of mystery that surrounds SoTC as you start your journey. You are given nothing but bows and arrows, a sword, and your trusty horse Agro. Graphics: The land is sometimes colorful, but it's supposed to be desolate so you won't see much life here. The real kudos goes to the animation that occurs during the boss bottles. Different motion blur affects really bring the game to a new level of realism. And Agro's animation is also cinema-worthy as well.Game play: The meat and potatoes of SoTC is the game-play. Ride on your steed in the direction of the colossus and begin to battle. You have 2 bars, grip strength and health. Grip determines how long you can hold on to things, such as the colossi themselves. The best part of game-play isn't done with your hands but your mind. Each colossus is a puzzle that must be solved. It can be determining it's weak spot, or even how to get on the thing. The colossus are so varied that each one will keep you guessing as to what to do next. While it will be hard, it will be one of the funnest experiences you've ever had.Audio: Some of the same tracks are repeated throughout here, but they never grow old. The music seems to match the mood. When you've just met the colossus you'll hear soft music while you figure out what to do. Then the music will rise as you mount the beast. All the pieces in here sound good and are great pieces.Overall: When you've beaten it and picked your jaw off the ground from the surprise ending, it's not over yet. You have time attack mode and hard mode which can be used to collect a few unlockables. While such modes seem trivial to me, I did mention that this was an extremely fun experience, so even I had to go through it again. This is an absolutely no-brain er, get Shadow of the Colossus now
- This GameCube is WEAK. I have owned both the NES and the Nintendo 64 and those were excellent gaming systems. Nintendo's recent system, the GameCube, has several problems with it's design. First of all, the internal fan is slow but, quiet. After an hour or so of use, the system overheats, thus shuts down. Second problem, the wireless controllers for this system SUCK. We have tried 4 brands and none have worked more than a week. The brands we have tried: Pelican, Intec, Nintendo, and Osmart. The third problem is that the system was not built to last. I still have the NES and Nintendo 64, which both work great! I doubt the GameCube will last past 4-5 years of use. Simply put, DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! ALSO! The Nintendo Wii is going to come out soon. From the description and from the specs, you will need to stand up and interact (move around and stuff) with the game. Sounds fun but, would you like to do that after a hard day of work? It will work something like the Sony Eye Toy.
- This game is fun and injoyable, but the bonus levels are questionable and it is almost better with less people
+ I hesitated a good while before picking this game up at a bargain price. Based upon various reviews and player feedback, I assumed that this game would be like 10 hours long, a bit buggy, and dumbed down. Fortunately, none of this was the case. I had some good fun with this over a weekend (yes, it can be finished over a weekend) and didn't come across a single bug. Fable is not in the same league as Morrowind, Oblivion, Gothic 2, or some of the other great role playing games (RPG) out there, but it does provide an enjoyable diversion.Game play: The controls are the typical WASD keys and mouse commands found in most single-player RPGs. The game is fairly easy to learn and navigate. The story traces the hero from childhood through adulthood, when he'll have to, you know, save the world. There are no character classes per se, but you can roughly play as a warrior, magic-user, or stealth/archer character, or some mixture of these.  Much of the story centers around a main quest line, but there are a number of side quests available. Unlike most RPGs, quests are assigned by quest cards that you pick up at the Heroes Guild (lol! That's what it's actually called).  It's a rather artificial-feeling system, but it's functional.  Progression in the game is quite linear. In most instances, you will not be able to even leave the beaten patch, since fences, rocks, and invisible barriers won't allow it. Compared to more open-ended RPGs like the Elder Scrolls series, Fable seems restrictive and light weight in this regard. Overall, it's a decent story, but it is rather force-fed to you.The game includes several interesting touches. People react to you based upon whether you've performed good or bad deeds. If you role play like a saint, you'll eventually have a halo and butterflies floating around. Ladies (and guys) will worship you, and you do have the option to buy a home and marry (multiple times if you'd like). If you play as an evil character, you'll eventually grow horns and fall out of favor with polite company. The nonplayer characters in the game, at least in the towns, have jobs and schedules. They work during the day and sleep at night, though only quest-related characters have anything to say of interest. Although you can only play the game as the same guy, you can customize him with tattoos, facial hair, haircuts, and a (small) assortment of armour. You can control how your character's skills develop, but not as deeply as you can in a game like Morrowind or Baldur's Gate. There are other small things that you can do, such as fish, play games of chance, and treasure hunt. Overall, this game takes about 20-25 hours to do everything it has to offer, so it is rather short for an RPG.The things that I didn't much care for are not major, but simply underscore the light-weight nature of this particular game. The game is certainly designed to appeal to the adolescent crowd, with hotkeys for burping, farting, and so forth. The various tattoo styles and haircuts further highlight this point. There is nothing really offensive in the game; it just feels a bit immature in places. Also, the save system is based mostly on the checkpoint model. You can't save just anywhere (at least your quest progress will not save), but the game will auto save at important junctures.Graphics: The game looks quite good. Character models are convincing (though a bit cartoon ish and often repeated), and the natural environment is screen shot beautiful in some places. Since the pathing is fairly restrictive, much of the scenery is non interactive. It's not like Oblivion or Gothic 2, where if you can see it then you can probably travel to it.Sounds: Voice acting is pretty good, with the usual British accents that invariably seem to accompany such games. The music is particularly well done and appropriate for the various atmospheres. Ambient sounds are also decent.Replayability/Technical Issues: The game is probably worth playing twice: once as a good guy and once as a bad guy. It will play similarly either way, but there are different ways to perform certain quests depending on your moral disposition. Technically, the game was perfectly stable on my computer--no freezes, crashes, or other problems. The manual is decent and explains much of the game, along with the in-game tutorial.If you like RPG games and can get this one cheap, go for it. It's a well-polished, though simple, rump through a fairly well rendered world. Don't expect the same character depth, engrossing story, or exploring options that you'll find in some of the games that I mentioned above. However, Fable: The Lost Chapters is good for several hours of entertainment.
+ Back when it came out on Box, I was incredibly angry...I only had a silly gameboy...but when it came out for computer, I just had to have it. I found the game very fun to play, simple controls (use arrows, not wads) and felt very fulfilled as the credits finally rolled after the last battle. It doesn't take long to finish this game, but play is continuous (if you watch the entire credits) and you can always start over and switch to evil/good side for a new version of the game
- I am a huge fan of the RPG genre and have played just about every one for the PC.  Morrow ind is the most boring one I have ever played.  I turned it off after two evenings of SLOWLY walking around, having stupid repetitive conversations with NPCs, and lamely fighting rats.  The interface is terrible.  You are very limited in what you can carry, so after you kill a monster you can't even carry your treasure back to town.  This "game" was all work with no fun.  Do not buy
- there are pros and cons of this card.PROS-its stores a lot of memoryable to save many files at one timecompactaffordableCONS-games that require 256 blocks will not be able to save!sometimes crashes.I tried saving with nhl 06 and it said it needed more memory. if you have a game that used 256 blocks get the game shark 16x memory car
+ Right, just so everyone knows, I have never played this game, however, I think you should read this.I bought Fable, and found that my computers graphics card was not compatible with it. It is good enough but not supported, so to avoid this I suggest checking the support section of the website before you buy to check that your card is compatible.As they have actually put a list of cards on the site, I assume that this problem is not uncommon so I advise you to check this before buying the game. Just thought you should know
+ I would be 5 on this one all the way, because I enjoyed the game immensely (the general idea of the game), but because of personal preference I stopped playing it because of excessive gore, sexual/debasing themes, and leud art. If you like this game but don't want all the questionable material (yes, I know that it's nothing compared to other games) then may I recommend "Fate" by wildtangen
- Make no mistake, this is the memory card for you if you've got a Gamecube (which I'm assuming you do, or you're planning on getting one soon).  Anyway, there are 251 blocks on this baby, which may not seem like a lot, but it is.  It gets the job done, and you don't have to worry about it corrupting data or anything.  I've had mine for a while and nothing has happened to the files saved on there.  It's also easy to save and delete information from this thing with the simple click of a button.Please, don't get that damn third party memory card from Madcatz, my experience with that is corrupted data, and constant reformatting of the card (which erases your files anyway).  Only go with Nintendo, they're the only ones who know the divine nature of their memory card. I must say, though, this is for the casual gamer.  Someone who doesn't have every game they can possibly get a hold of.  Some EA games, for example, take up over one-hundred blocks of memory.  Basically, what I'm saying is simple: If you're one who has a ton of games, you may find yourself buying more than one of these memory cards before you know it.  Not every game has a save for just the game.  Resident Evil, for example, saves on a different block every time.  Just like a PlayStation memory card.  If you're like me, however, you probably don't have THAT many games that it's a bother. The other thing I must caution is simple: This thing, like every other memory card, is small as hell.  This one even more so.  If you can, keep it plugged in your Gamecube at all times.  The great thing about memory cards, just about everyone of them, is simple: You can take them anywhere.  Does your same friend also own Super Mario Sunshine?  Hey, that's great, now you can leave your copy of the game at home and take your memory card.  It lightens the load. It's essential to have a memory card if you buy a Gamecube, and this is a good one.  If, however, you happen to be someone who has a TON of games, this won't hold you over long enough, and you'll have to buy another.No Gamecube owner should be without a memory card, though.
- Remember all those countless super hero licensed beat 'em Pu's that plagued 16-bit systems?  At first glance EA's Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects might not seem like that type of game, but make no mistake that it is: a repetitive and quickly boring beat 'em up with a host of technical issues.  You can play as a variety of Marvel Comics heroes and villains, as well as six "Imperfects": cyborg-esque warriors created specifically for the game.  The single player mode is ungodly repetitive as you battle hordes of generically created enemies.  This gets boring real quick, with button mashing galore and repetitive game-play.  The destructable environments seem like a good plus at first, but you'll soon learn how much they actually work against you in a brawl, and it becomes more frustrating than it should be.  The cumbersome control scheme adds to this, not to mention that the controls can get to be quite buggy as well.  The graphics look sharp from a distance, but the game has an odd look to it like it doesn't know if it wants to look like Spider-Man 2 or Ultimate Spider-Man (both are great games that are much more worth your time than this), and the in game cut scenes look godawful.  There are a few saving graces which save Marvel Nemesis from being a complete clunker, including a horde of unlock able content that comic fans will love.  The Marvel heroes' super powers are nicely pulled off, including Storm's weather attacks and Daredevil's agility, and the online support is where the most fun from the game is to be had.  Other than that though, there's not much else here to hold your interest.  If you're looking for a great super hero game, check out the X-Men Legends series or the aforementioned Ultimate Spider-Man.  If you're looking for a great beat 'em up, check out Rock star's the Warriors; all of which are more worthwhile than this
+ I do not own the headset yet, but I have already ordered it from amazon, and It is supposed to come awhile after my box live starter kit, so I will have to use my lousy wired control er with the stock headset until this new one comes. My impression is that it will be a very good product, because it is ligate, and I have that wireless joystick for PC that they make, and it is fabulous. The price? Great price. I got mine for something like $25. (buy from abut4u)but it looks like a great product and I look forward to receiving my headset. Yes, 6 hours can last me a weekend.
- This review is in reference to "Nancy Drew: Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon Game + Strategy Guide" edition. I've played 3 or 4 of the Drew games.  This one played faster and was over before the time it took to install the game. Before I had installed 'Blue Moon Canyon', I had installed "Morrow ind the Game of the Year Edition", which sold for five dollars less than 'Blue Moon Canyon'. Morrowind is a huge 4 disc game that has, at the bare minimum, 400 hours of game-play, and possibly might literally be endless. The entire Morrowind set had been installed and up and running within 15-20 minutes. After I had installed and played 'Blue Moon Canyon' we installed and got up and running "Age of Mythology Gold" also within 20 minutes. This is another massive game, a Real Time Strategy game that included the expansion pack "The Titans". Both 'Mythology' games were completely installed.  This is another game that can be played and explored for years.  The two game set sold for five dollars more than 'Blue Moon Canyon', or the original full retail price of the strategy guide edition. "The Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon" took so long to download...we went out for dinner and let it download while we were gone.  We have a P4 at 3.2Ghz, an 80GB HD, of which only 23GB were used, and 1.5 GB of RAM.  There is no reason on earth why Nancy Drew games should take so long, over an hour, to download...unless their copy protection program conflicted with our Toshiba Super-Multi Drive drivers. The actual installation was not as painful as the download.  What was painful was the game-play.  I had a lot of fun playing the 'Secret of the Old Clock'.  Whereas most of the Amazon user reviews came across as lukewarm to the game, I liked playing the golf game, and the car chase, and the "bank shots" of reflective light beams to be aligned.  I even felt proud when I finally got the sewing completed. I knew that the Drew games wouldn't deliver the value that the two games (mentioned above) did.  But after the reading the reviews of 'Blue Moon' I expected to have more fun than I did with 'Secret', even though I knew it would be short lived. What a let down.  The game was over in two or three hours. Most of the game-play was a memory test of what order what button was pushed or stick was knocked over, or  which way the track leaned to.  The 'arcade' games in the General Store were just hit the button or in this case 'click the mouse'. You didn't even have to look.  The most complicated task was getting a piece of paper to do a rubbing. It was very boring. Between the price, the concern over the length of the download, the most unimaginative game-play set to walking back and forth on a train, I cannot recommend this game as being fun. It had a few moments with the Math/scale problems but it wasn't enough to carry the game or balance the huge amount of needless dialogue the player has to endure listening to. I realize I'm an adult, but the eight year-old little girl (I bought it for) lost interest after the first 15 minutes.  She was wiser than I. Sorry Nance, this one is a waste of money, and might contribute to hardware damage with driver conflicts. 
+ First things first, there IS a mute button on this unit.  If a user taps the power button, the sound will mute on and off.  I'm guessing the previous reviewers who complained that there was no mute button either didn't read the instructions or couldn't figure out a product with three buttons on it (power/mute, volume up and volume down).Second, this is the best way to use the xbox communicator when you have a Ligate wireless controller.  It works well, and I noticed no sound quality decrease from the regular XBox communicator
+ PROS: 1.) Wireless2.) Small3.) Lightweight4.) You can talk to your friends when you're in the bathroom.5.) It has a lot of noises to tell you it's turning on and off and when the volume is at its max.CONS:1.) Cliking and piping noises2.) My charger doesn't connect to the headset without a rubber band.3.) There is zero background noise cancellation for high pitched noises, like my sister.4.) Have to charge it, why can't it just have a fuel cell?5.) No mute stat is or indicator.6.) It makes piping noises and a white nois
- I didn't like clue chronicles I sat there for 5 hours and still couldn't figure it out, I got so far and couldn't get any further. this was a waste of my money, if I could sell it I would, I like the regular clue better, that is why I bought this I thought it was something like the old one, when I seen it wasn't, I thought this might be fun, but as I was playing it I hated it more and more. I have sat down and tried this game 10 different times and I end up in the same spot and cant get no where else. I hate I
- We recommend not buying this game, unless you don't mind a buggy version that is not supported by Hasbro and can't be fixed.  Hasbro has decided not to support the game and the patches at the website are no longer available.  Save your money and wait for the next one, hopefully bug free
+ There isn't a whole lot I can add to the other reviews, but I disagree when some say that this game is challenging.  I bought this game about a week ago and I've already beaten it.  No guide, no internet Valkyries, no cheats.  Honestly, that's never been the case for me with ANY GTA game that I've played.  Heck, I'm still trying to beat San Andreas (I play straight up with no cheats or guides/helpers) and I've had that game for over a year now.   The ending is kind of cheesy too, but it's still a good game and makes for a great pacifier until the next GTA comes out.  And at $20, you can't really go wrong anyway
- I bought this game about a week ago. I had not purchased the prequel (so?) to this game and did not know what to expect. I began playing the game and immediately got bored about 30-45 minutes later. I have no played the game since. Here's why:The graphics, to me, are ridiculously annoying. It makes the game feel so unrealistic. The graphics are a step lower than "NBA Street" and even more unrealistic. The real problem is that there is just nothing to do. You enter tournaments and they all feel the same. The little side missions are laughable, and I feel like turning off my Ps2 and smashing the controller on my head repetitively every time I play one of them. I can go on and on about why I hated this game. But I won't. The bottom line is that I strongly urge you not to waste your money. The cover and appearance of the game appealed to me and made me want to buy the game...but don't let that happen to you
- After playing this game for the third time I had a thought, 'WHY DID I BUY THIS!' This game is extremely unoriginal and gets boring very quickly. I cannot notice any difference and improvements from the first balers and other NBA Street's. Save your money and do not purchase this dreadful game
+ Your back in liberty City (just like GTA 3) you cant fly, swim, clime (just like GTA 3) No graphics upgrade. No airplanes. Glitches like crazy. Same as PPS. But if your looking for a game to just play and have fun and enjoy the int resting/funny/good story line than get this.20 bucks cant go wrong.
+ The Grand Theft Auto series and the PlayStation 2 have gone hand in hand, which each game debuting on the PS2 before it travels to other consoles. That all changed with the release of last year's side story, Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories. This game, designed to take advantage of the PSP's hardware, was an impressive technical feat, managing to pack in a lot of what made the "big" GTA games so memorable. But it fell short in a few key spots, most notably the story, the characters, and the series' biting sense of style and satire. That stuff was easy to overlook when you could carry Liberty City around in your back pocket. But on the PS2, where you can compare it directly to the three Grand Theft Auto games that have appeared there, the whole package is significantly less interesting, even considering the PS2 port's budget price.  Not much has changed, so if you've already played this on the PSP, there's not much reason to take on the PS2 version. The game's got a slightly longer draw distance on the PlayStation 2, and the streets look like they might have a few more people on them. But neither of these things dramatically changes the game, and they can't save the game's otherwise murky visuals and often poor frame rate. But it also controls a little better; with the right analog stick back in effect, you've got all the camera control and other buttons you're used to hitting on the PS2. It's neither elegant nor particularly noteworthy, but if you didn't play it on the PSP, Liberty City Stories' $20 price tag is just right. Just don't go in expecting anything approaching the grandiose nature of GTAIII, let alone the bigger, crazier Vice City or San Andreas. And if you've already played it on the PSP, well, there's little reason to play it again, because this is the same game, with the multiplier modes stripped out. As a return to Liberty City, the New York-themed locale first made famous back in Grand Theft Auto III, Liberty City Stories is all about retreading through well-worn territory. If you still remember the streets of Liberty City, you'll see plenty of the same spots here. But as a game that was designed for the less powerful PSP, you'll probably notice that Liberty City Stories is much smaller in scope than what we've seen in the series more recently. Missions, which grew to epic proportions in San Andreas, are much shorter and feel pretty meaningless in LCD. There are plenty of moments where you'll complete a mission and immediately think, "Well, at least I'll never have to do that again." The story, however, is the biggest casualty. Liberty City Stories tells the tale of one Toni Cyprian, a regular-type mob guy who did a good deed for the head of the Leone crime family, Salvatore Leone. Toni had to go away for awhile, but the heat's died down, and he's back on the job in Liberty City, maintaining his loyalty to Sal while wiping out the family's enemies in droves along the way. As you ascend to become Salvatore's right-hand man, you'll start and finish gang wars with other mafia types, a few triads, the yakuza...pretty much all of the usual suspects are present. If you're familiar with the various mafia presences over the course of the past three GTA games, you'll recognize a few of the names and faces here. But the story stands alone and doesn't require you to remember the various cast members. That's a good thing, because the mafia characters in the other GTA games have been largely forgettable. The game's storyline really isn't up to par with the console installments in the series, because very little actually happens. Even potential plot points are squandered, like when Toni finally becomes a made man but a bad cutscene doesn't actually show the ceremony. The game's mission path doesn't deviate into crazy territory, and most of the characters are fairly lifeless. There are no enigmatic weirdos like Truth, the crazy hippie from San Andreas, or Steve Scott, the porno director from Vice City, to break up the heavier-handed mafia tasks. This dulls the game's personality, preventing its characters and events from becoming as memorable as we've come to expect from GTA games and their excellent storylines.
+ This Games Story Takes Place Before GTA 3 So It's Sort Of Like A Pr equal Set In Liberty City Compared To The Original It Looks A Lot Better Plus They Added Bikes And Motor Cycles And Attempted To Improve The Targeting By Using The Targeting System From San Andreas I Hate The Targeting But Being Able Target Manually Is A Good Thing If You Don't Own A PSP I'd Suggest Getting This Game But If You Do And Played It On That System There Really Isn't Any Point To Buying This Game Unless You Really Really Love GTA
+ I bought this one the same time I did Ba ten Kaitos Origins and I can say it don't hold up to the original but comes close. you can tell Square had their hands in this one, I liked the 2-D style of the first one the 3-D graphics are very impressive but don't really fit with the game-play. My 4 star overall comes again from the battle system. It holds true to the 1 button controls 1 character but the movement system needs to go. it uses a full range system like Star Ocean but changes to the "attack view" to do the fighting similar to the original. Ultimate Magic and those really awesome super moves are still intact. I'm not far into the game and they already have 2 characters from the original star here and thats Arngrim and Lezard Valeth, which is cool they were 2 of my favs, I cant wait to see all the characters. If the make Valkyrie Profile 3: Hrist I would like to see a return of the hand drawn sprites and the riddence of that movement system. `
- poor quality ,out of box you can only play KQ7. almost useless very dis pointed that they even sell this game as it is
+ I never played the original and don't really want to. This game was such a treasure to find with it's phenomonal music and graphics, engrossing game-play, twisted plot, and the variety of characters possible to play. I have lost a lot of sleep over this game and I'm not even half way done.If anything, it has some of the best show of PS2 graphics I have seen-something to expect from a Square-Enix production. The wind moving through the environments, the water trickling, the sort-of dream-like haze in the towns. It all culminates into an eye-pleaser if nothing else. But the game-play and game engineering is also top quality. The character designs are very diverse with many periods of time and cultures represented. There is a fairly even mix of female and male characters as well as classes like archers, light warriors, mages, ect. The menu navigation and ability to load different game data at anytime (other than combat) is a serious perk that many take for granted. You can keep loading a game when you don't get the einherjar you want until the randomized selection gives you the perfect group you are looking to adventure with. The ability to instantly travel to any location on the map without lengthy travel from location to location keeps the pace nice and brisk giving you only what you want, buying equipment and battles. The difficulty is right where it needs to be, if you do a quick run game, you will have a tough time beating the boss. It's nice not to have leveling forced on you but rather as an elective thing so that you can get through the story when you want to. The battles are clever, mixing tactical RPG with action making it very engaging and actually fun. There is a degree of button mashing, but then again, it's not a static or boring as the your turn, my turn, cast a spell, drink a potion. It's actually combat, like it should be. I can't praise this game enough...I don't care how good the first was, it can't be better than this one. This will certainly go down as a best title for the PS2. If I had any complaints, it would be the recycled voice-commentary for different einherjar and the fact that they really aren't involved with the main story-line. Oh, and since they would be stupid not to make a third one, customizable armour would have been the cream of the crop. VP2 is a solid offering for the last PS2 has to offer
- My gripe is about KQ6.  One customer said that there were no differences between the cd and disk versions. This information is false. At the time of its origional release, I was fortunate to have a high end computer (for its time) that was able to run the Windows CD version of KQ6 which had much better graphics and Character Illustrations. I was beyond upset when I found out that this was nothing but the DOS version. I bought this to play the windows version that to my knowlage does not work in any way on any OS past win95 (maybe 98). Those who have played and have been waiting to play the Windows CD version will be very upset
- I loved this game as a child and I spent many hours playing it. I was incredibly excited to be able to play it on my Laptop. OOPS they didn;t update any of the drivers for the first two games (Kings Quest 1and2) so after about 15 minutes of playing you can't see the screen due to all of the graphic errors. There are no patches available as of yet and it dosn't look like any are on the way. I feel pretty ripped off. It says on the cover in big print. "Runs on Windows XP." Barely, and not very well when it does. If you are interested in this game check to see if Vivendi has done any patches before you buy it or you will be disapointed. Better yet download one of the fan-made editions for free online. They work
+ My experience with developer tri-ace's games dates back to the original PlayStation era with Star Ocean:The 2nd Story. Like most gamers on this side of the world, this was probably the one of the first tri-ace titles that had and created enough of a buzz to form a niche of fans. The other game, which is credited with a similar yet even bigger buzz, was the original Valkyrie Profile.Unfortunately, the yield from the initial pressing run of that game was so low (so tri-ace wouldn't lose to much if the game didn't sell or catch on) by the time I had heard the hype surrounding VP and wanted to give the game a try it was much too late... copies of the game were selling at astronomical prices on e-bay much like how sealed copies of Final Fantasy VII are selling now. Because of this I was ecstatic when a sequel - which in this case is actually a prequel - was announced so I could finally experience what I had missed out on the first time in one form or another. Granted, VP2 is not a complete carbon copy of the original, but the majority of the game-play elements cross the game/generation gap, so in essence this game should probably give you an idea of what the original itself was like.So, would I say that I was blown away or impressed by what I missed out with missing the original VP? Not really.To start with, the game is simply beautiful. There are some dazzling effects, from leaves and grass waving in the breeze to various types of weather pounding some of the locals. This is what one should expect from a last generation PS2 title. Sure, every once in a while the battle camera might clip some polygons so it looks like your characters are standing on air, but that is so minor it doesn't matter. The only gripe I have is I wish the characters weapons changed depending on what they currently have equipped. However, since the character designs are so dependant on the default look of the weaponry, the above simply wouldn't work very well.Combat is Valkyrie's claim to fame, much like it is in other tri-ace games like Star Ocean. This is a good thing, considering the amount of time you'll spend in battle mode leveling up the game's massive number of characters (of which only a handful are actually involved in the story, the others just seem to be there). At a quick glance, the battle system seems to be a button mashers dream, but like a good 3D fighting series (Soul Caliber or Taken) those who know what their doing will always get further or have less difficulty as things can be difficult enough. Other combat related issues also sprout up: reviving an ally requires you to be near the ally's body and status effects are so not your friend - especially when the whole party is inflicted at once (especially with poison) *shutter* .As fun as combat is, there are quite a few hitches to be aware of, such as wasting AP on a dash and getting nowhere because your party is caught on the edge of "something" in the environment or when party members become separated for the same reason, limiting your attack options until you take the time and go back and get them. This becomes especially aggravating when you're trying to finish battles as quickly and efficiently as possible to receive experience and crystal bonuses. The change from a 2D fighting environment in VP to a 3D one in VP2 works, but the above issues make you yearn for 2D battles of the original which would probably be devoid of these problems.The game's skill system is another area that initially seems interesting and clever but quickly becomes quite cumbersome. You'll form rune words with your equipment and accessories to unlock new "potential" skills. Note the word "potential" in the previous sentence. Unlocking a new skill doesn't grant the character the skill automatically - only though battle can the skill be used and permanently learned. At first glance this is a good thing since it prevents abuse (think FFIX skill system here), but the player then quickly finds out it "may" (well, usually) take a long to learn said skill. Instead of being awarded a set amount of points towards your skills after an enemy defeat like in most normal RPGs, a percentage earned towards potential skills based on the average level of your current party and that of the enemy(s). Because of this you'll constantly be seeking out stronger and stronger enemies and you'll hardly ever find an "undeniable great place" to level up. You'll also be contending with the never ending equipping and equipping of equipment while doing this and often means your party is usually far from wearing the strongest available equipment at all times - something that is usually a given in most RPGs.Traversing dungeons is probably the most noteworthy aspect of VP2 after the battle system. The first few are a complete cakewalk and teach you the ropes, the later ones can really test you sanity and your brainpower. Correct sealstone usage and photon know-how go a long way towards completely clearing them of all their contents. Kudos to tri-ace for the awesome auto map feature - features like this need to become an industry/genre standard!In the sound department, Motoi Sakuraba makes a rather subdued yet solid entrance, seeming to ditch his rather unique yet unorthodox style of composing. It's not until much later until you hear a piece and you know "yeah, that's Sakuraba, no doubt". The voice-overs are good, but at the same time just a few tiers above decent.Valkyrie Profile 2 also falls victim to problems that are prevalent in other tri-ace games. Some moments of unbalanced game-play creep up on the player as the difficulty goes up a few notches without much warning. The story is once again slow to start (is this even a surprise anymore with tri-ace games?), and some of the story twists you can see coming a mile away (the one revelation at the end of Chapter 3 was so freaking obvious!).All this said is Valkyrie Profile 2 worth playing if you've never experienced VP? Yes. However, now having experienced it, I honestly think I could have had waited for a price drop instead of buying it on day it came out. Despite this, I still look forward to playing the re-release of the original on the PSP. 
- Hey, have you ever played Caesar II from the 1990s? Yeah, well this game is basically a knock-off of that game with better graphics. And quite frankly, Caesar II was more fun. I don't see how CivCity has any point. You build your city and nothing interesting ever happens. There is no progression to the game that keeps it fresh. The makers inter grated technologies and wonders from the successful Civilization game series, but they are inconsequential in this game. These people should stick to what they are good at, the Civilization series, and leave city games to people who know how to do it. I've heard that a new installment of the Caesar series is out now, Caesar IV, and I haven't tried it, but it has to be better than CivCity Rome. This game is boring, don't pay any money for it.
+ In truth, there really hasn't been a great Mana game since Secret of Mana back in 1993.  Every Mana game since has been met with astonishing mixed feelings, and Children of Mana is no different.  Why did I buy it knowing this?  For the same reason many Mana fans continue to invest in Mana games.  There's always hope that the next installment will give us the same joy that Secret of Mana did.  Unfortunately, Children of Mana does not do this.  It doesn't rekindle the magic Secret of Mana gave us, but that shouldn't suggest it falls short of it either. The world is in peril when a mana imbalance threatens to send the world back into the dark ages.  It is up to a hero or heroine to stop this from happening and thus you'll set out to save the Mana Tree and the world itself.  Children of Mana by no means has a great storyline going for it.  At least where it falls short in story it more than makes up for in game-play.No matter how you look at it, Children of Mana is a dungeon crawler.  It is an RPG, but it falls into the dungeon crawling category.  When you enter dungeons they're just swarming with monsters, and you'll be surrounded before you know it.  So you'll have to make your way through a dungeon battling everything in sight until you reach the boss, take him on, and then you're done.  Rinse and repeat.  The process does, at times become annoying, but Children of Mana offers some variety and interesting aspects to the game-play to make up for it. The first tidbit of interest is how combat works.  It's actually pretty fun to go through dungeons killing things.  It's surprisingly addictive for the first couple of hours.  You've got three hit combos you can perform on enemies.  You can knock enemies into other enemies.  There's quite a bit of inter sting things you can do.  However, what also sets it apart from a lot of dungeon crawlers is that you can't ahead of yourself too fast.  First and foremost, you can't equip and use everything you find right off the bat.  The game will actually restrict you from using overly powerful weapons until you have access to certain dungeons or until you meet certain expectations.  This keeps the game from being too simple.You'll also have access to magic, of course.  Each time you go into a dungeon you can take a spirit with you and use the magic that spirit provides for you.  It's interesting to play around with as well.  In dungeons you can also dual wield weapons, although not in the way you'd think.  When I say duel wield I specifically mean you can equip two weapons but only use one each time.  So you can't go about swinging both of them at the same time, which probably would've added more variety to the game-play otherwise. Along the lines of giving your character a different assortment of weapons, you can also give them gems that can improve their stats or combat abilities.  It's interesting, but not really all that deep.  You'll mostly find or purchase these gems.Another interesting aspect is that the game is completely linear should you decide to dwell into the many side quests the game has to offer.  Children of Mana is not shy about offering you side missions to go on, and they're actually pretty well worth it.  The problem with the game-play, however is that this rinse and repeat formula becomes very tiring very fast.  The objective in just about every dungeon is to find what's called a "Gleam Drop" and then bring it back to the "Gleam Well."  It's annoying mostly because each dungeon plays out in the same way.  Fight through a horde of enemies, retrieve the Gleam Drop, fight a boss and leave.  Over time it becomes increasingly repetitive.  However, Children of Mana has a great remedy for that too.  It's multi-player.  Up to four players can play at a time, and the game is so much more fun that way.  You and your friends can make your way through dungeons together, and sometimes it's just a blast to do.  There are moments of slowdown when playing in multi?-player mode, but it's nothing to get too frustrated with, because it doesn't happen too often.  The multi-player alone adds a lot of variety and complexity to the game-play.   As far as graphics go the game doesn't look too bad.  The sprites look like they're ripped straight ouf of Sword of Mana... and the game is completely 2D.  However, the Mana games have not been about taking graphics to the limit, they've been about its unique art style, which in Children of Mana is absolutely gorgeous.  It's artwork is just beautiful to look at.  Each environment is given extremely good detail.  The only problem, as I mentioned, are that the sprites are not nearly as detailed.  Musically, Children of Mana sounds fantastic.  It's one of the best sounding DS games out to date.  Very few of the current games hold a candle up to it's fantastic soundtrack. The bottom line is simple: Children of Mana is a very fun game to play with a very mediocre storyline.  There's just enough variety and interest in the game-play to keep one going for the adventure, even if the storyline is just not all that great to begin with.  However, keep in mind that Children of Mana really is just a dungeon crawl, and it's unrealistic to expect an RPG that's all about dungeon crawling to have a fantastic storyline that will blow you away.  On the whole, if you're looking for a game that's fun, you'll find it with Children of Mana.  However, if you're looking for a game with a deep storyline and endearing characters, you won't find it in Children of Mana.The Good+Beautiful Artwork+Fantastic Soundtrack+There's a lot of variety to the game-play+Multi-Player is a blasts+Tons of side quests to do The Bad-The storyline isn't good-The game-play has a lot of variety, but it's hard to get past the fact that it's repetitive
- I brought this after having played Caesar3 and loved it but wanted something with a bit more scope for controlling dynamics of a city - and I thought being a CivCity game this would offer me the extension - WRONG - this is a bad rip off of Caesar3, sure, graphics are more advanced with the zoom in view but other than that I was playing the same game but with less involvement or control. This is a sit back and let it happen to you game - keep the people happy and build everything and they'll stay. Caesar IV - that's what you're wanting, it looks like everything this sets itself up to be that it isn't. Feel like I've wasted my money
+ I played through the first Halo and really enjoyed the single-player campaign.  I never played the multi-player game until I bought Halo 2. Let's get this out of the way first: Halo 2's multi-player is unparalleled.  With a multitude of multi-player games (Capture the Flag, Juggernaut, Team vs. Team, etc.) and a dizzying variety of terrains, there's plenty to keep Halo fans busy blowing each other up.  The addition of the alien Elites as a playable character spice things up.  You can also wield two weapons at a time, one in each fist, providing another combat option for those gunslingers that like their battles John Woo-style.  Unfortunately, Halo 2's single-player campaign is not as impressive.  To whit, the alien Covenant's entire society is based on the idea that activating the giant rings throughout the universe (known as Halos) will put them on their journey of spiritual evolution.  The reality is that Halo is a weapon designed to destroy the Flood, an infestation of aliens who turn human and alien alike into vicious zombies.  And how do you keep the Flood from infecting every living thing?  Why, by utterly destroying every living thing in the universe of course!Play alternates between Master Chief and the alien elite known as the Arbiter.  This gives the player both sides of the story, which is interesting...to a point.  Eventually, the plot converges enough so that the two characters should really end up fighting each other.  That would have been something, if the AI made you play through both battles from opposite sides by creating an enemy that uses your own moves.  But instead, about midway through the battle for the universe, a giant plant that looks like Audrey II from Little Shop of Horrors shows up. This planet, speaking in Jabba-esque guttural tones, rams the plot down our throats by grabbing the Arbiter and Master Chief and shoving them into opposite plot lines: the Arbiter ends up working with the humans, Master Chief ends up doing the alien dirty work.  Then things really get going, and just as Halo 2 hurtles towards the final battle on Earth...the game ends. I should have guessed something was up when, during E3 interviews about Halo 3, the CEO of Bungee only had this to say: "Are you ready to finish the war?" What he meant was, "Are you ready to finish the game you thought you were finishing in Halo 2?"As you've probably noticed from my review of the second installment of Pirates of the Caribbean, I really, really, REALLY hate movies and games that fail to provide a whole story.  It doesn't matter that this is part two of a three-part series.  Writers and developers have an obligation to provide a full story; you CAN create a story with a beginning and end even though it's the middle of a series, as evidenced by The Two Towers. Halo 2 is an improvement on the original, but it loses points for a weak campaign that forces you to play both sides, then throws in a talking plant to clean up the mess.
+ After my little brother lost my original copy I had to buy a new one and I am so glad I did. I love the game and it was so much fun to play. Like all Final Fantasy game the graphics were amazing as was the game-play
- I was really looking forward to this game, and I was prepared to overlook one or two things.  Every game has it's own personality, right?  I found instead this game actually doesn't have much of one at all.  I didn't mind the graphics.  Not cutting edge sure, but not that bad either.  A little muddy but a change from cartoony.  It was hard to enjoy closeup views, however, when so many buildings lost their roof on zoom.  No way to toggle that feature.  The camera angles were frustrating and it was very difficult to pick anything out with the mouse accurately.  Not that there was much time to look at the scenery.  Immigrants came.  And came.  And came.  Whether there were houses and jobs available or not.  As long as city happiness was high enough, which meant that everyone was happy.  Which they were not.  Because they had no houses or jobs.  To keep city happiness up was the only way to ensure a somewhat stable economy.  Forget planning.  Forget balancing resources with workshops and markets.  It wasn't clear what the balance was in any case.  It would take trial and error, and you didn't have the time.  For you were building worships like mad, trying to guess at how many citizens would be employed by each, and researching for temporary bumps to keep your city from being deserted in droves.  The best income boosts were not through sale of goods or trade.  It was through research, maximizing the tax base with the development of currency and so on.  You hit those early on, and reached a certain population level, you made money.  The rest of the time you spent trying to keep people from leaving.  There was no stability in reaching any level.  It quickly became a game of keep up.  There was no way to control immigration or set the pace of development.  And for all the decorative options, more than the similar games out, you really didn't care in the end what your city looked like, because it just cost time.  Money too, but that was really not the relevant issue.  Unless people were unhappy.  Then you could stick a few things, quickly, somewhere.  You just can't enjoy a leisurely pace of planning, building and finishing it off with a nudge here and there and watching it run...you have to be constantly involved in the process, staying ahead of the curve.  You don't have to worry about maintenance, such as city fires or engineers, but the cities cannot not be made self-sufficient or self-sustaining with this inherent instability built into the game-play.  Five or ten minutes away from the screen will bring most cities, if not all, to a screeching halt.While I enjoyed the research options, and the ability to move homes I thought was a great innovation, not having the ability to control the flow of immigrants to the city and pegging success to city happiness makes this game a poor economic simulation and the game-play ultimately very shallow and unsatisfying.
+ If you liked final fantasy 3, you'll like this game.  You'll play some, then learn some more of the story.
+ I thoroughly enjoyed playing Final Fantasy VIII.  From the introductory movie I was hooked.  The world and story were very unique, as well as the new battle system.  I thought the junction system was fairly easy to understand and once I got used to it, I loved it more than the material system of VII.  The characters in VIII were all very likeable.  It was interesting to play the game from the perspective of a student named Squall, who happens to be one of my favourite heroes of the Final Fantasy series.   The cinematics in the game were very nicely produced and captured the best moments.  From start to finish, I had fun playing this game and highly recommend it to fans of the Final Fantasy series and role playing games in general.   
- The Civ name has been tarnished.  Analogously, one thing I have been learning is that just because Sid Meier's name is on a product, it doesn't mean the product is good.In the case of CivCity: Rome, unfortunately, it doesn't just come in at "modestly good" - it comes in at "dismally poor."  I've tried hard not to let this influence my beliefs about Civilization in general, but after Civ4 came out, I am starting to believe that Firaxis Games and Sid Meier are on their way out.  And now this...I regret to inform that the great Civ titles were made a long time ago.  The offerings of today have a simple pattern: the production was rushed and the title came out with major bugs; the games add unnecessary features designed to justify the overall cost; and the consumers are often abused with ridiculous expansion packs containing features that should OBVIOUSLY have been included in the original release - they take advantage of our love for the franchise.This pattern is so evident that the whole Sid Meier and Civ franchise is degenerating.  It almost seems, especially with the release of CivCity: Rome, that we are once again expected to simply drop cash for new products based on our love for the old.  But the developers are not living up to our expectations for producing great games!Stay away from CivCity: Rome.  Besides the obvious blunders associated with all the bugs, you will see that even the best patch cannot make the graphics look good, the narration and sound effects better, or the interface to work properly.  The game is a dismal failure, and I am sorry to report that.  It seems like Firefly Studios had an idea and got the license from Firaxis, but they just cheesed it.Watching what Maxis (The Sims and SimCity franchises) and Firaxis (Civilization franchise) are doing to their most loyal fans is like watching your dad get drunk
- It has pretty much all been said, let's just say it again 'cause I'm sure Firaxis/Firefly will plant positive reviews here. The game takes ages to load, the voice acting is silly (British? Australian? Herman's Hermits?), the progression is totally linear (ie the game fails to become more complicated at higher levels), the graphics date to 2002, and the citizen 'fetching' system is completely random and opaque. Sit and watch for awhile: your huts will change size every thirty seconds. Most importantly, boo Sid, boo. You would've produced this bad Caesar3 ripoff and called it anything, but you called it "CivCity", and even put a tiny Civilopedia in it. Haven't you got enough money? The Civ Series is brilliant. Don't cash it in
+ first off, let me say for the most part, katamari damacy is an amazing game.  if you don't know the story behind it, well, it wasn't thought up by game designers and that's why it's so original.  the game ideas came from a lady who didn't even like video games, and they used her ideas to make it.  in a world where if you've played one RPG, you've played them all, if you've played one shooter you've played them all, etc. katamari damacy is a HUGE breath of fresh air, and I'm glad it's popular.  the music is strangely catchy, it has a great sense of humor, the attention to detail is absolutely astounding (a ton of work must have went into this game), and it's surprisingly very addictive and fun.  in fact, unless you've actually played this game, you won't understand how fun and addictive it is.  show me many games and I can say "I'd like that" or "I wouldn't like that," but katamari damacy is a game you actually have to play to understand.  and there's even a 2 player mode where you can compete against a friend!  you roll around a "katamari" (a ball of stuff) and pick up more and more stuff that automatically sticks to your katamari.  the bigger your katamari gets, the bigger stuff you can pick up!  if this sounds stupid to you, there's a reason:  you haven't played it yet.  trust me, it rocks!  while katamari damacy looks like a kid's game... it's not.  there's too much strategy, too much nuance here for young minds.  on the other hand, younger kids can play chess, so.. maybe.  but generally kids play stuff like halo 2, that requires little thought.  my complaint is level 4.  I've tried about 10 times to beat this level and from what I see, I don't think I will ever be able to, so for me the game stops here.  it has a 10 minute time limit, and the closest I've got 73 cm (I need to get to 1 m).  I'm not a gaming genius or anything, but I'm at least an average gamer and regularly play online against other gamers and do very well.  in my opinion, they really "dropped the ball" on this level with such a strict requirement.  to be honest, I'm really surprised anybody has beaten this level, with so little time.  how many more times should I try?  5?  20?  100?  it's disappointing.  maybe "me and my katamari" is more gaming friendly?another thing is, the view on the screen isn't quite big enough.  it's very easy to be lost, with so little of a view.  you can't change the camera angle, you can only turn around.  it would probably be better with a bigger camera view and a camera that changes angles automatically.also, the controls to turn around and "charge" are too difficult.  to turn around you press L3 and R3 at the same time... why not just have us a press a button?  to charge, you flip the analog sticks up and down really fast.  too much trouble for a feature that's pretty useless anyway.  why would you want to "run" when you'll just run into something anyway?  the game consists of a lot of moving back and forth and to the side, you don't need to move forward fast.  so it's not a perfect game, but it's very impressive nonetheless..  I just wish I could play the rest of it.  :(
+ I played this game with some friends out-of-town, and seriously had to acquire a PS2 just to satisfy my craving.  Not a shooter game, not an rpg, you just roll.  Seriously.  It's surprisingly awesome actually - but my big disappointment came when after about 2 days of mildly committed playing, it was done.  I'd beat it, and I'm really not a big gamer.  And I don't know how much mileage I'm really gonna get out of the sort of limited 2-player mode.  Maybe the sequel is better - I hope
+ when I first saw the game for number 5 on top games. I new I wanted it. My little bro like eww that game is horrible. I ask my grandma 2 buy it for me and it so fun. I love it if u like games that r easy than play this on
- The games faults have been well covered already so I'll just say, if a Roman era city builder is what your looking for save your money and wait for Caesar IV. After playing the demo I can say that this will be a FAR superior game than CivCity on every level. It seems to be the game the makers of CivCity were trying to make but failed miserably.
+ Unlike any other game you've ever played--in the best possible way. I am easily bored and/or grossed out by the traditional racing, shooting, killing zombie games and this game was a refreshing change. Challenging enough to keep you entertained for quite a long time. Other reviewers have said it ends too soon, but the game lets you repeat each level to beat your previous best score. So, if you barely beat the level, you can do it over until you have totally blown it out of the water. Perfect for a pair of obsessive-compulsive like my fiance and me. He thought it looked stupid when we bought it but now he plays it more than I do AND his 6-going-on-7-year-old-son loves it, too. There isn't anything that would be inappropriate for any age, but a kid younger than 6 or 7 probably wouldn't get it. (After he goes to bed we play the insanely gory Jaws game--you get to be the SHARK!!) You might think that rolling up stuff to make a big ball would get old fast, but the King of All Cosmos keeps it exciting with the challenges and surprises. The levels just get cooler and cooler.Also, the music is fantastic. It will have you singing along in no time.  Na na na na na na na na KATAMARI DAMASHI! It doesn't even make sense but I love it!I just ordered the second Katamari game, "We Love Katamari." `Nuff said.
- Like the other reviews, I find this game a rip-off of Caesar III. (I didn't know there was a IV! Must look into that.) While the graphics are admirable, the game-play wasn't challenging at all. It didn't take me any time at all to win, and I'm one of the worst game players ever. OTOH, it's a good afternoon waster if all you want to do is build and perfect your city in open play with no goals. Don't buy it now. Wait until it's cheap, like $9.95 or something.
- Graphics aren't the most important part of a game to me.  I already owned Oblivion when I bought Gothic 2 because I was hoping it would be a darker and more mature "Oblivion" style RPG.  While it does have much more mature content than Oblivion,.. I never got to see it because of the bad controls,.. bad collision and lack of fun.  (By bad collision I'm talking about your character walking through or getting stuck on objects.)   The only weapons you can find at first are a tree branch and a tiny dagger.  There are no easy enemies to fight for a Level 1 character.  Even the little gremlin looking guys in the first cave by that pond at the beginning totally beat the crap out of you with ease.  The controls make combat an unfun chore.  I'm a patient and forgiving gamer but Gothic 2 barely has half the quality of Elder Scrolls 4 : Oblivion.  If you've never played Oblivion and don't have an XBox 360 or a PC that can run it,.. then maybe you'll get into Gothic 2.  It has much lower system requirements
+ I got this game for my kids. One is 11 and one is 9. They love it. They can have like video conferences with their friends and there are a lot of fun games for it. Like baseball,soccer,boxing,etc. Hey this even come with the camera. I rated 4 stars because of the Graffias. They are not the best, but still acceptable. Hope this review helps
- The controls are very difficult and I understand they wanted "realism" but they killed a lot of fun by making you just so damned vulnerable to EVERYTHING.  I'm a long-time gamer and I can handle a tough game but this is just frustrating to the extreme.  Plus for all the people talking about immersion...I just don't see it.  I just couldn't get myself to care about the world or story I was in; it didn't grab me like some games do
- Bought this game on the strength of some reviews here but I was very disappointed with it. Clunky control system really put me off
- The concept for this game is strong, and it's got some cute ideas, but the voice recognition - especially for the word "blue" - and the character recognition is abysmal.  It makes the "game" an exercise in frustration, more than anything else.  As to character recognition...unless you write in whatever font the game is programmed to recognize, it's going to record your answers as something different than what you wrote.You are penalized when the system doesn't recognize "blue" or the correct number.  If the system is so rigid that it only accepts one way of saying "blue", then the system should have a sound file that tells you what it wants to hear.  As to the number recognition, it should have a screen that shows you how the system wants the numbers written, or it should be able to allow you to enter your numbers and correlate them to numbers within the system.  (When I make this mark, it = 4)Also, the "intro" content is absurdly long, with no way to skip over it.  Huge waste of time after the first 10x you've seen it.  I just got the game today, and I've spent hours trying to figure out a way to say blue such that the game will recognize it...now, I just wish I could return opened software.  I'm very frustrated with the entire experience
- Playing Icewind Dale II reminds me of all of those novels written by American authors in the late 19Th century. Though many of the novels were very well written, they never seemed to suck me in and continue reading the book. Icewind Dale II is like that. It looks nice, it supposedly improves game-play, and it gives the player more character creation options, but I just don't really want to play it. Why? Well, at the end of the day, it seems as if Icewind Dale II is hurt by a extremely corny story; it is bogged down in numerous irrelevant puzzles involving you running around constantly; it is just not as fun as its predecessor. I bought this game for one reason and that reason was that I was addicted to Baldur's Gate II and needed to expand my party based rpg addiction to another realm. Icewind Dale II seemed to be the logical option. I was wrong. I was immediately confronted with a story so corny that it is almost embarrassing to take part in. I was confronted with game-play that caused me to run back and forth from one place to another constantly. I was confronted with battles so easy that I was soon bored. I tried to play it again, but again I was plagued with the same problems. I installed a bunch of unofficial patches, but those did not solve the problems with the terrible puzzles and whatever else. The overload of puzzles and corniness would be ok if you could diverge from the one path as you could in Baldur's Gate II, where you could accomplish quests at the order that you wanted to. Here you had to accomplish everything in a linear order and could never diverge from the path. Furthermore, the story seemed to be a retread of the story from the original Icewind Dale. In fact, the design of the game seemed to paralell it completely. The final problem with this game concerns the fact that it is difficult to play if you have no knowledge of dungeons and dragons rules. If you do not know how to use rogues or are unfamiliar with feats and the like, this game will pose a very high learning curve that you may not want to climb. I was mostly familiar with the rules, but it was easy to see that someone who did not know them as well could easily make mistakes or be unfamiliar with the use of certain classes (even though the rule book was pretty exhaustive). All in all, I do not think that this is a good game. I would just go with Baldur's Gate II or Icewind Dale I instead of this game.
- Firstly, I have been a big fan of the aurora engine for PC based RPG games.  I loved BAG 1 and 2 plus the first IWD but the sequel to which I found, to be honest, awful.  I was raised with the 2nd edition rule set and I have never played the 3rd (with the exception of NWN) but the fact that this game is based on the newer set of rules didn't bother me much.  It's a computer game after all, the exact mechanics of the system I don't have to understand.  The thing that did bother me about this game is the fact that it was one big battle after another.  Your commanders send you on endless suicide runs.  It got to the point where I could simply leave my game ruining for an hour or two while my charters could hack and slash their way through the tide of randomly spawned critters.It got boring really fast.  Not too mention difficult as well.  The really sad part was, when I read the general plot outline, I was enthusiastic.  I have always wanted to see what would happen if the Orc races banned together in an army and attempted to invade.  But, when you and your 5 companions are the only ones on the front lines against an army... this is the point where (in pen and paper RPG's) that I tell the fellow who is hiring me to shove it
+ I bought this game as a Xmas gift for my 6 and 10 year old boys. They play this game NON-STOP, basically until they're completely worn out. The game is a perfect way for kids to get exercise in the long winter months! If your kids have a PS2, then this game is a must have!!
- This game looked so crazy I couldn't resist it.  I mean Disney and Squaresoft trying to merge Final Fantasy and a load of Disney cartoons must have seemed like a cool idea in Japan since they love cartoons so much, but in the USA it's just insane.  On top of that you have voice talents from Mandy Moore to Lance Bass, and as production values go you knew you had to be in for one of most ridiculous games in history.   Hardcore fans were bothered that this looked like a kids' game but aren't games supposed to be aimed at children and teens anyway?I was ultimately disappointed with Kingdom Hearts.  The world and characters of Kingdom Hearts is not really about a Final Fantasy Disney crossover it's just a place for the kids you control to have out their little melodrama.  It's like the idea of Disney meets Final Fantasy just takes a back seat.  Once you get past all the hype Kingdom Hearts is boring and frustrating.  A nagging issue is the tiny areas in this game.  "Planet Alice in Wonderland" consists of four small rooms of course you will spend a great deal of time in them fighting off monsters.  The combat is a blend of chaotic button mashing and watching your party members act like total fools until they die.  The worst of it is respawning monsters, you can't take a step without having to fight and re-fight hoards of shadow munchkins that you had just defeated.  Because of this you'll spend the majority of your money on healing items.  Bosses are a nightmare since they are hard to survive and take forever to kill (30 minutes is normal.)  Since combat is so simple it really makes the drawn out battles beyond boring.  After beating 2 bosses I was done with this game.  I know that Kingdom Hearts 2, Mushashi Samurai Legend, and Final Fantasy 13 all have the same combat woes.  I wish Squaresoft would learn that respawning enemies and bosses with 9 million hit points are a thing of the past
- Now, before you say anything, I have played this game and beaten it in the week provided by blockbuster(grudgingly playing it though)and now for the unbaiased opinion. I think that this game is so completely stupid. It and the sequel are retarded but again its my opinion.
+ So, these little fellas are inside my computer. They run around all day shouting, "Doodler-door! Doodler-door!" I'm thinking that they're up to no good. I'm thinking that they're plotting against me. But I can't turn them off. They say if I do then evil will befall me. Caution! Beware
- I really could not tell you anything, as I still have not received this game, despite having paid for it over a month and a half ago
- Please promise me you will never play this.  It is not worth your time.  If you paid money for it, try to find the person you gave that money to and kick them in the shin.  Hard.  Then throw your copy of this game in the dumpster.Seriously though, this game is absolutely terrible.  The graphics are bad even for the PSX, the combat quickly becomes boring as all hell, the story line was confused and the fact that there was a second dimension pointless.  There was no reason for there being 40 something characters, most of them were exactly the same statwise, and all of them were poorly designed.  The most annoying thing in the world, bar nothing, is having to re-equip all your character's spells whenever you switch characters.  You have like 50 spell slots.  God.  I don't think I even need to say it, but those crumbums at Square couldn't pull another hit out of their oversized Victorian tophats if they wanted too.  They should really stick with straight to video Final Fantasy 7 anime movies from now on, lest they risk making something like this again
+ ...and not just a half-baked product placement tool. BioWare's decision to make the game pre-date the movies was a great one because it gave them considerable creative freedom, even within the confines of the Star Wars brand.The biggest reason why KOTOR won over 40 game-of-the-year awards (yes, over 40) is not because you get to swing a double-bladed light saber around and use Force powers; it's because of the story! A strong plot is crucial for every RPG, and KOTOR doesn't disappoint. This plot of course includes one of the biggest twists in video game history (all you fans out there know what I'm talking about! If you don't, then go out and buy this game now).The game's principal characters, while somewhat stereotypical (I.e. Bastila is the condescending socialite snob, Carth is the tough loner with a troubled past, etc), work very well together and have good chemistry, including with you, the created character. For example, if you play as a female character, it soon becomes obvious that Carth develops feelings for you, but he feels slightly guilty because he lost his wife not too long ago. You'll also find yourself acting as mediator when some of your allies don't get along with each other, I.e. Canderous and Carth, because they fought on opposite sides in the Mandalorian Wars that took place five years before. And aside from the character development, the game feels very rich in its "Star Wars-ness" -- for example, some of the names that BioWare came up with for the planets and people feel and sound like George Lucas himself approved them.Despite what I said earlier in this review, cutting down your enemies with a light saber and looking good doing it has got to be one of the joys of KOTOR. I admit that when I first got to Dantooine and was on the verge of becoming a Jedi, I was trembling at excitement that I was going to build my own light saber, as I wondered what color I was going to choose.Having said all that, there are some things that keep this game from getting 5 stars. I felt the game was a bit linear (being able to choose your planets in any order only gives the ILLUSION of open-ended game-play). I was hoping that the storyline would be different depending on whether I decide to be evil or good, but everything plays the same, save a few minor events and certain conversations. Also, there is a "doorway bug" that causes you to sometimes get stuck when moving through a doorway or narrow corridors. When this happens you can wiggle the thumb stick and free yourself; I've never had any real problems with this bug, but it can get distracting. Also I found moving around in the menu screens to be problematic; you press start to go to the main menu, then you pull the trigger buttons to move between the screens, but often I have to pull the trigger multiple times before the game responds. Also, I'm sure many people would agree that the game's graphics are not up to Xbox standards; even the PS2 is capable of doing better! I don't usually gripe about graphics, but the textures on some background buildings on Taris are downright laughable.Overall, I have to give BioWare serious Kudos for taking on a daunting task like creating a new Star Wars game, and I sing their eternal praises for actually making it fun. It is not a stretch to say that I bought an Xbox just to play KOTOR (and a few other titles, but that's another story), and I'm glad I made the investment. Hey, stop reading this and go play
- The first game we played on Gamecube was Spongebob, Battle for Bikini Bottom.  We absolutely loved it and my daughter plays it over and over.  Thinking Shrek 2 would be similar, we rented it.  It's very hard to control the c-stick and it kept zooming in and out and wouldn't rotate the camera except for certain times.  The char actors were very distant and even if we used the c-stick to zoom in, it still wasn't close enough.  It's the same feeling as needing to put eyeglasses on to see something more clearly! Another aspect we didn't like was the four char actors are always together and you would lose track of which one was the main character.  Maybe we're spoiled because the c-stick on Spongebob allowed you to rotate in every direction to see what was around you and the graphics were so good you could see facial expressions.  It's surprising all the reviews are so good because our impression was completely opposite. 
- I loved "The Incredibles," so I was excited to play the game.  I've only been playing video games the last couple years, and only off and on, so I'm really just a beginner.  Perhaps that explains the enormous difficulty I've had with this game.  My boyfriend is a long-time video game player, and he was able to do things in one or two tries that I labored for hours over.  Even using cheat codes did not really help me all that much.  I was surprised when I read the review that said the game was too easy.  I almost cried.  LOL  But seriously, unless you are a good gamer, you're probably going to be more frustrated than challenged by this game.  As for me, I guess I'll stick to action RPGs
+ Pros:- Exciting and absorbing story line.- Great gaming experience.Cons:- Some minor bugs.- Single player game.- Cannot replay more than a few times
+ First point, thankfully this wasn't directed by good 'ole George.  The setting of the game is 4,000 years before the Star Wars: A New Hope, and a few years after the devastating Mandolorian Wars.  This a truly fun Role-Playing Game (RPG) including interesting characters- everyone of them with unique histories (including yours), an almost flawless turn-based combat system, a sinister universe dominating villian, etc.  At this point, the graphics aren't the greatest, but are still nothing to scoff at.  There are some bugs with the dialogue and movies, but nothing serious.  The music, produced by the gaming-world famous Jeremy Soule is amazing and completely allows the player to become immersed with game-play.  Basically, every action (mostly dialogue) has a good (Light Side), Neutral, and bad (Dark Side) outcome.  For some reason, the dark side way of going about things is more full filling....  Many movie seen force powers (lightning, force choke) as well as some powers known to Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR) are included keeping you on your toes while playing.  *Spoiler Alert* Incredibly (it is a small universe) all of the characters you meet that become apart of your party have to do with your past self. *Over*  At two parts of your journey, once in the beginning and once more a fourth of the way in, the player gets to choose the class of his/her character.  First time around, what kind of grunt of the Old Republic's are you? and second, what kind of SUPER-ALL-POWERFUL-KICK-A**-BITE-YOUR-HEAD-OFF Jedi are you?One of the best XBox games ever. period. and one of the better RPGs out there as well
-   hi- it was impossible to use this product because the key they gave me didn't work. I might make a Frisbee out of the DVD!                                              Jerri
+ This was a well put-together game that was lots of fun to play.  You'll want to play it again as soon as you finish it.  I'm not a big Star Wars fan but I was nuts for this game.This was the first RPG I ever tried and once I got over the fact that "I was not doing the fighting", I really liked it.I highly recommend this game UNLESS you already have a weak relationship with your wife/kids (who you won't be seeing much of) or if your boss hates you and is waiting for you to come in late and bleary-eyed so he can pink-slip you
- Bought this Platinum game with much anticipation and it doesn't work at all.  Tried the download .exe patch and does nothing and to top it off half the original game forum sites crash too.  No one has any idea how to fix this game and all you have to do is look at the dozen of patches out on first game.  If they had spent the time and money to build the game and test it right like Blizzard does and companies like Westwood was then they would release a finished game but decided to use everyone as gunea pigs to test the product so they could try to patch it to work.DO NOT BUY ANYTHING from this company or its affiliates I think they are Alkida implants trying to take over the western world. If you want to play a game with style then wait until June and get "Titan's Quest" which should be finally a Diablo 3.   Too bad this company couldn't find the capital to complete the game before release and would think anyone wanting to buy Spellforce 2 should be warned upfront to make sure you wait for about 6 months after release and buy an additional hard drive so you can download the new Patch fixes they will probably try to smoke screen you with as they count their money and send it to Iran
- I have a pretty decent computer (Athlon64/3000+, Radeon X550), but this game does not work at all.  Even after I download and install the patch from Aspyr (though there is no excuse for the game to not at least load straight out of the box), spellforce.exe just sits there and sucks up 99% of the CPU until I kill the process.  Aspyr support is unable to help.That said, despite other reviews here, this game does NOT install Starforce.  But maybe that's why my version won't work..
+ This game is delightful the choices of dialouge are great you can turn most conversations in to hillarious situations. There are so many options to what class of sith you would like to become if you go down the dark side, or what class of wimpy jedi you would like to become if you choose the light. Either way the game is great, and if you become a sith lord and get the power to perform a "force Crush" on your opponent you are very lucky... Give this game a whirl
+ Quite honestly I think it is to be expected that the original would be better than the second especially with a series such as this where you choose what happens in the plot (light or dark side).  With the first game of a series such as this its easier to write a plot that will run smoothly because you have a clean slate but with the second game you cant really make it so it runs so smoothly.  You have to make the game so it runs smoothly no matter which path you chose on the first game which I think is a pretty difficult task.  They did ok with this task but at times the actual story line was quite confusing but overall they did ok.  I do think they did a better job with the powers and such.  You were able to get a lot higher level then you did in the previous game so you received more powers. The game was not awful by any means.  I think that if you play the game knowing its not going to live up to KOTOR 1 you will enjoy it quite a bit more.  I recommend that you play the first KOTOR before playing this one because then you will see the series at its full potential and appreciate it a lot more. Also know that it's not going to be as good as KOTOR 1 when you start playing, it helps quite a bit
+ I don't really review games, because video games are nothing much to talk about.  But anyway, these obe star reviewers are all idiots. Okay so sometimes idiots who play this game for ten hours a day are idiots also, but that's not the point.  The people who write one star reviewers are all stupid fragile Hilary Clinton Supporters ans support that stupid dumbf*** jack thompson. Freaking imbeciles.  Okay now, this game rules.  This game kciks because I can do anything I want.  If I want to race a car, blah blah blah.  I just wanted top get my point across to the one star reviewers.  If you don't have this, get it, I don't care how, but get it. Remember, that most people who write crap pro bally actually never tried it or stupid like Jack Thompson
- this game is just the original + a crappy beam system where you spin to the right when you lock beams and the game play is totally repetitive also their isn't any in game transforming at ALL!! I hate this game so MUCH!! it is literally the worst DBZ game I have ever played {and I have played them all) I advise you if your looking for a new DBZ game wait for the next one because their shure isnt anything new here but a crappy beam system. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME EVER!!!!
- There is nothing majorly wrong with this game.  The plot is well-developed, the characters are customizable, and the battles are strategic.  This is probably primarily subjective, but I just didn't enjoy this game.  It's not because there were too many movies--it's because I didn't like the movie.  I also didn't like the characters or the villains or for that matter the aesthetics.  There were some minor but annoying flaws in the game which further contributed to my displeasure.  Which button to press was often counterintuitive, and so I often found myself pressing the wrong button.  Also, the game badly needs a journal and/or a destination guide so you know where to go--I once spent one hour doing nothing other than walking around a space ship trying to figure out where to go
- I actually recieved this from a friend of mine, which he bought for $0.98. Anyway, I said that there were television shows that I thought were interesting, but were only sold over in the UK (and so on). He told me that the AR MAX was a REGION X DVD reader. So, I took it home, and decided on buying a TV series that was a Region 2, and just recieved it today, to my surprise (not actually) the damn thing didn't work. Now I'm stuck with a Region 2 DVD with nothing to play it in. I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT! If you are buying this for the reason that it reads other Regions of DVD's...DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! It is junk. However, I am thankful that I didn't even buy this product, but it was given to me. I hope that someone planning on buying this, reads my review first. IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY
- I have found only one game out of the many that I have tried that the codes on this thing actually work on.  This action replay is basically a twenty dollar or more waste of plastic and the cardboard that it came in.  avoid like the plague
+ No way should children be playing this game.  It is for mature players as the subject matter could confuse younger players.  The goals of harming people, picking up hookers, breaking the law, can be a blast as long as everyone knows it's just a fantasy.  Many people go into the details so I'll make this short.  Have a good time while pretending to be a bad guy who does unforgivable acts.  But there's no way I would consider this game for anyone under 15, and then I would have to know that the teen can handle the fantasy. 
+ I loved this game so much I have gone and got a second copy, mine has stopped working!I love the feeling that an entire world lives within the game and you can always just steal a car and ride, listen to the radio and take in Vice City's many sites.Tommy Vercetti - excellantly cast as Ray Liotta of Goodfellas fame gets out of the slammer and goes back to his turf.  He gets sent to Vice City to get him out of the way because really, they don't want him around anymore and they certainly don't want to answer his questions about why he got jailed.You can ride bikes, take cars, helicopter fly over the city, go through districts with different cultures and work for many gangs.  Bikers, Columbians cops even, accompanied by a sound track that beats the heck out of any other game I've played.  A radio with enough variation to keep everyone happy as they do their drive-bys and cruise looking at women.And the talk shows!  Classy touch.The game play is smooth and with barely a bug to be seen flows from day to night and back again with the city in sync, Vice City at night is amazing, you also get weather variations and the impact of that, in the rain, bikes tend to skid more and you fall off.  It's that kind of attention to detail that means the game never grows tiresome.  The hidden jumps to be done with all manner of vehicles and the taxi/paramedic, etc missions mean the game really is so open ended.  It's been three years and I'm still exploring Vice City.Classic
+ Despite all of the controversy over its violent content, the Grand Theft Auto series of video games deliver time after time with the best entertainment bang for your buck. In my opinion Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is the best game out of the series so far. Yes, the missions are a bit easier than those in San Andreas, but Vice City is a better overall experience. The setting is beautiful, there are more properties that you can own, and the automotive,firearm and weapon selections are also quite large. The soundtrack to this game is amazing. From 80's pop to metal to old school rap and hillarious talk radio, its all here. Grand Theft Auto is the greatest videogame series ever because it combines fun, challenges, and elements of real life triumphs and consequences in one well produced package
+ As you might have guessed, this is another cool game I have played in the arcade. AND IT ROCKS! Time Crisis 2 was wonderful but this is just outstanding. I mean, it has cooler graphics, more usable weapons(including grenades! YOWSERS!)better sound effects and above all such terrific explosions, shot hits, music and game-play that it makes this the best Time Crisis Game I've ever played in my whole, entire (BEEP)ing life! When I played this in the arcade, I had tons and tons of fun. Why you think I put five stars for the fun rating? To make this game even more enjoyable, I used the fact I am a lover of animals and good people, most especially lions, tigers, jaguars and sexy women of all sorts. I imagined that those kinds of innocents mentioned were being threatened, that the enemy in the game was the poacher slime threatening them(as you know, I not only love big cats, all cool animals and decent human beings, I also HATE, HATE, HATE poachers!)and that I was the hero along with a sidekick who meant to save the women and the three large cat races. Needless to say, every time I killed an enemy, with bullet or grenade, I let loose the words: "Go to hell, poacher scumbags!" which of course made the game all the more enjoyable, as did saving lives which I imagined as either a big cat species or a beautiful woman. Anyway  whether you imagine this or not, this game is the best, coolest and most fun Time Crisis ever made and if you like shooting games or video games in general for that matter, you must either play this in the arcade(like me)or if you got a PS2, buy it and enjoy! I'd say it rivals the masterpiece that is Silent Scope, it's so perfect
+ I've played it countless times at the arcade and I think it is one of the best games for ps2 (cause actually I'm more of a PC gamer) amd it is the best of it's kind. If youre looking for a guncon game, this is for you!game-play: as I've said, BEST OF ITS KIND. TC3 is one of the few guncon games that will keep you glued to the TV (and in my case, arcade screen) for hours and hours and wont get repetitive. and the multi-weapon system will give you more strategy and less (in a good way,) mindless crazy shooting. For example, if you were outnumbered in a closed space with a lot foes on the screen, in any other guncon game you'd have to shoot them all down one by one, ducking like a madman and losing time but now, you'd just select the Nader launcher, aim, and clear the area of enemies. but, the grenade launcher has a limited amount of ammo, so would you spray with the Uzi with a fast rate of fire or use the shotgun that spreads its bullets? your choice. but the strategy doesn't bore the game, you still ave plenty of time to shoot people silly graphics: the graphics aren't like Half Life 2 or Doom 3 but its still isn't horrible, and anyway, you wont mind the graphics when you're really playing the game.Sound: the dialog is crappy like any other guncon game, but everything else is above par and again, you wont care about the sound when you're really playing the game story: Not the best, its predictable, corny and it isn't complex at all, but if you're looking for a great storyline in a guncon game... you need serious help. Overall: the only flaws I could find were that the game was overpriced, (60$) and that the guncon is pretty fragile (From what I've heard). Other than that, its a must buy for anyone who likes shooting, crazy action, or wants to let their anger out on some terrorists
+ I've got to be honest, this game has been more entertaining than probably the last three games I've bought, not that they were bad though. The funny thing about these kind of games (so long as you're using a light gun) is that they improve your accuracy with firearms. It's no substitute for real shooting, but then again, how often do you spend hours shooting probably thousands of rounds like in these games? Now, on the game itself, the graphics are good enough, but the arcade style makes it look... well, not real. But then again that is part of what gives the game it's charm. Buy the game, and a light gun
- AVOID THIS PRODUCT, wait till PS3 with it's Hard drive an hope something better will come out.Memory cards are flash memory an flash memory is FRAGILE, one whoops an it's destroyed.Damn to hell Sony for making us pop 25 bucks a memory card in the first place.BAD:STAY AWAY FROM MAX MEMORY MANAGER... DO NOT LOAD GAME SAVES FROM THE INTERNET ONTO YOUR MEMORY CARDS. IT WILL CORRUPT AN DESTROY YOUR MEMORY CARD/CARDS. One memory card is worth more than this stupid thing. I lost two memory cards an ALL my bazillion hours of game-play. ALSO... the disc sucks, when the PS2 is warm, it won't recognize the discounting you break or mess the disc up, no way you can make a copy of it an use that. Your screwed!GOOD:The codes work an it's great to whip through a game that was driving you nuts or stressing you out before.If you have complaints, call Datels US office(727) 431-065
- FROM AMAZON.CA---------The Action Replay MAX is more than just a video game enhancer (VGE)....or at least it claims to be. My version is quite old yet but it claims to include a Region-free DVD player and a memory card compression utility (squeeze more saves onto your memory card). I have not used either of these features personally, but I have heard horror stories about the memory manager corrupting game saves and whole memory cards; some reusable, some permanently damaged. This and the fact that you must load up the action replay software to access saves that use the memory manager turned me off of using it. However, the real reason I bought the ARMax was for its codes and I'll get to those in a second.The ARMax, like the newer Game sharks, loads its software from a CD. This is a major annoyance for me. Every time you load a game you must insert the ARMax memory card (which does I don't know what) and CD, go sit on the couch and wait for the software to load, choose your codes, then get up and put the actual game DVD in and wait for it to load. You can't simply turn on your PS2 and go sit down. In the old days of cartridge gaming you would snap the VGE between the game and the console so you could turn on the console and go sit down. The early generation Game sharks had a little box that would attach to an expansion slot on the PS1 or N64 and that was it. If you wanted it to load before the game, you turned on its switch. Even if the ARMax was perfect in every other way (and it's not, btw), it would get a maximum of 4 stars as long as you had to boot it from a CD first. I mean, why can't the memory card part of it at least hold the codes for even just the current game you're playing after the system is shut off or reset so you don't have to load the software EVERY D@MN TIME.Ok, rant over. On to the codes. The user interface for the ARMax is better than the Gameshark. Functionally, they are very similar of course, but the ARMax just feels cleaner and easier to use. It offers a Beginner interface that includes descriptions of code functions (not for user-entered ones though, if I remember right), and a more robust Expert Mode. On big advantage, in theory, that the ARMax has over the Gameshark is its ability to update itself using your PS2's broadband connection. The upshot is you can download new codes for your favourite games fairly quickly instead of manually typing them all in using the controller. The dark cloud to go with this silver lining is that you have no control over which codes you download; its all or nothing. And since these updates are stored on your memory card (not the ARMax one), it will quickly fill up with codes and gamesaves for games 99% of which you will NEVER play! No wonder the ARMax has the option to come with 16 or 32MB of space on its memory card. It's to store all the useless codes! Any entered codes you choose to apply will either work, do nothing, or lock up the game. I have come across all, though to ARMax's credit, mostly the former. The absurd choice forcing you to download and save updates for every game in the PS2 library, when you may want just one, loses the ARMax another star. A note about manually entering codes: The sub-headings and folders for a game have their own codes that must be entered if you want them to show up in the game's code list.Finally, as mentioned in the reviews by Bret Morris and Glenn Nichols (Amazon.ca), the ARMax initially did not work with the new revision of the fat PS2 a couple years ago AT ALL. This happened for me as well. I returned three PS2s and two ARMaxes before I realized it was a defect in all current versions (at the time) of ARMax. I had to send away and get a new disc direct from Intec which now works as well as expected. Since the ARMax has been on shelves for several years since I bought mine, I assume any bought today would not have this problem. However, at the time there was no way to find out about this problem without contacting Intec personally. Retailers were not aware of the problem and no notices were posted on the Code Junkies web site. This inadequate treatment of a widespread problem drops ARMax down to two stars.In my opinion, if you're in the market for a VGE, both ARMax and Gameshark have their pros and cons. I would assume both have released newer versions with newer features than the ones I have. Looks at the specs, assume nothing, and don't be afraid to e-mail the companies requesting details regarding any features you have questions about.I apologize for the length of this review, but I find there are very few in-depth reviews of VGEs on the web or in print. Maybe reviewers feel they are above using VGEs, I don't know.
+ Time crises is a 5 star game
- I bought this product after reading that you can update the code list via a network connection, or using a USB flash drive.  I have not been able to get either to work correctly.  After following their instructions on the Datel website on how to update the codes using a USB drive, it deleted my game saves on the memory card.  It also corrupted the memory card, and corrupted saves on the card in slot 2.  I have had nothing but trouble with it, it's slow and doesn't live up to the promises.  Their customer support is lousy, with a response that merely said...sorry.  Well thanks a lot to them...just lost hours of game saves!!
- I honestly do not like cheat devices, but since Wild Arms 4 came out, it actually now has a use. Let me explain...Unfortunately, thanks to an programming on the part of Xseed Publishing (the company that translated Wild Arms 4) it is impossible to unlock two of the bonus contents in the game without the aid of this device, or a similar device like a Gameshark. Since this is the cheapest of all said devices, if you are hellbent on unlocking everything in that game, you'll want to shell out the twenty dollars for this.If it wasn't for this reason, I wouldn't even be interested in this product.
- Then this will not work on your console.But if you have the huge old PS2 console then this will work on you console.If you do have the slim console then you should get a game shark
+ Square Enix is going back in time with their latest Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS titles. First we had Final Fantasy 1 and 2 on the GBA which were brilliant recreations of the original Nintendo Entertainment System titles that started the Final Fantasy series way back when. Then last year we had the first SNES Final Fantasy game in Final Fantasy IV Advance on the GBA which recaptured the fun that really made the series a house hold staple keeping the game the same as we remember with extras added in to make it even more fun then we remembered. Final Fantasy III which was a Japanese only exclusive NES game is now on the Nintendo DS introducing a new yet old game to fans old and young.Now with their next title in Final Fantasy V, will Square Enix again capture the magic that made their old games so much fun? The answer is absolutely yes!This game is a great example of why the job class system, that Final Fantasy has become well known for, is so much fun to interact with. You start out with a team of four who have to save four special elemental crystals from being destroyed. Every time a crystal does happen to be destroyed the crystals will lend the would be heroes it's powers letting them change their classes into more powerful fighters, magic users and specialist in the hopes of saving various worlds from a great evil in the name of Exdeath. The story can be a bit on the weakside. Besides the point of fighting evil just because they are good guys and that's what good guys do there is not much more to the story then your typical Final Fantasy situation. The real draw of the game is the idea of building your dream team of characters in the classes you want to build them into. Some of the classes most will be familiar with if you have played a Final Fantasy Tactics game. There are some new and unique ones but over all they all have their pro's and con's and let you switch between them easy enough while being able to use previously learned abilities from one job into another job. There are your typical classes in the Knight, Black Mage, White Mage, Monk and Thief. While there are more obscure job titles like Berzerker, Dancer, Beastmaster and Bard that add a lot of originality and newness to the game as it lets you be classes that you may have never thought of being in a Final Fantasy world. A lot of the game will focus around you leveling up due to the fact that the only way to learn new skills for your current classes are to gain job points by winning battles. Also it can get quite expensive buying equipment for all the different classes as a lot use very specific weapons like whips bows and axes while most use swords and daggers. So this game is not one that you will be able to rush through quickly if you want to get the full experience out of it. Overall this is a great addition to any fan of a good RPG series both young and old. The story is the only weakness as it could have been a bit better but the fun of the game and your own ability to choose what type of fighters you want to use at any given time make you forget quickly of the story going on and keeps you focused on the action and having fun with the many classes to find. With three worlds, over 20 class choices, bonus classes and dungeons not found in the original games and so much more to do in this game you definitely can't go wrong picking this up. A very worthy, yet not as well known game in the long running Final Fantasy series. Especially with Final Fantasy VI Advance on the way, this is a great way to pass the time until it becomes available. This isn't the greatest Final Fantasy game, but it seems to fit in perfect to the portable setting it has been put into. Get it today so you too can max out all the job abilities for all the characters.
+ You already knew it was a good game because it's Final Fantasy, probably the biggest and most popular series in the history of video games.This one is probably a little worse than the best Final Fantasy games (such as III and VII) but, despite that, what you have here is a Game Boy Advance RPG that has graphics that actually aren't that bad, and the storyline is pretty good too.  You just can't go wrong with Final Fantasy games. 
- As far as I am concerned this game is total garbage and I would not recommend it to any one. I do not know why it was ever released..!! Deer hunter 2003 is the same way I tossed both of them in the garbage. Trophy hunter 2003 is a much different story. The game play is very good and the graphics are up to par with to days fast computers..
- I bought this from Best Buy for $25 dollars thinking it would give my Xbox360 a longer life and keep it's insides cool.When I plugged it in, my Xbox360 didn't turn on AT ALL.  After trying it several times, I took it off and plugged in the AC adapter back on to my Xbox.  For a while, the XBox wouldn't turn on.  I thought it was broken.  I gave a it a few minutes and luckily it turned back on, but that Inter cooler nearly broke my Xbox.DON"T BUY IT
+ Before Kurt Warner had a career with the St. Louis Rams, he played for the Arena bowl champion Iowa Barnstormers when he endorsed this game called "Kurt Warner's Arena Football Unleashed." The music is rock in' and up to date you can crank it up to. The sound effects are great on this game, if you hear that doing! sound, it looks like a Hanna-Barbera cartoon. and the commentary is way better than that Tim guy from NFL Blitz. Oh, and for every touchdown, you be treated to a song of joy as you score for 6. This game is way more better than NFL Blitz, unfortunately, it was the last hope for any more Arena Football games on any system
+ I'm an AFL fan and have been for a while, so I got this game, since it sounded interesting. It's not the truest sim out there, it's more like NFL Blitz but indoors. Still, it's a very fun game if you remember the 2000 AFL season. I would have liked to seen more of these games, for each season. At least this game will satisfy my appetite for AFL football. I would suggest all AFL fans to get this game, simply for the joy it will bring to you, and the fact that this is the only repesentation of the best brand of football out there. I just wish other smaller leagues (like the WNBA) would get a contract for games, since there are many fans of these lesser known sports that would love to have sim games. GO RATTLERS GO PRED
- First of all, it's sad that someone would put out a product (the 360) that gets so hot that it tends to fry itself, unless you spend another 10% of the product cost on a little series of fans.Second, I attached this. I plugged it in. It wouldn't even turn on. Waste of money. Do yourself a favor and just keep your machine in an open, uncluttered, unblocked area. If you absolutely must provide additional airflow, just point a $10 clip-on fan at it
+ I'll admit I was a little skeptical about this game. As it turns out, this game rocks! Arena Football fans do not pass this one up! Hopefully when  they make the sequel(yeah, I said SEQUEL)they will include the new AFL2  teams. Tennessee Valley Vipers rule
+ After the incredible "Monkey Island" series was halted, I feared that I would never find another series of games that had such imaginative storylines, entertaining dialogue, and lush scenery. Then "Bully" came along, and I was hooked. This really is a great game, and you shouldn't be set against it because it's really nothing at all like Grand Theft Auto. There's no blood, no sexuality (except for kissing), and there's so many involving and engrossing storylines. The characters are also some of the best I've ever seen, each having their own stories and personality. The whole clique thing also reminds you of your days in high school. GET BULLY-- IT'S AN AWESOME GAME. People who like this game should also look at the "Monkey Island" series of games for PC and PS2, and the "Nancy Drew" series for PC
- Stay away from this product, my inter cooler, while noisy as all hell worked for a good 3 months, but I continuously got random red-circles-of-death until my 360 got another one today and couldn't recover. This product will mess up your 360 because of the way the power cord has to go through it first.Terrible product that cost me 140$ and a whole month without my xbox while I wait for it to be repaired
+ This game was a lot of fun, you can do so much and the dark humor was great.  The only gripe I have is that it was just way to short and easy.  I easily beat this game in about 3 days, and I still have 2 days left on my rental.  I would say rent this game, because you can easily beat it within a week.  So overall, here is a break down of the Pros and Cons.Pros:-Playing pranks on students -The missions are a lot of fun-The side missions are also a lot of fun, bring more to the story-Good Dark Comedy, like all other Rock star games-Unlocking funny consumes, like the black ninja costume to stay out past curfew-All the different Cliques were great, and being able to beat up and bully anybody is a lot of fun Cons:-Just way too easy, the missions can be beaten very easily.-Incredibly short, nothing like the Grand Theft Auto Games where it can take a month to unlock everything, I was able to unlock everything in 3 days.-Would've loved to see some of the same things from GTA:SA in Bully.  EX: In GTA:SA you are able to have gang members follow you and do what you want.  It would've been great to see that in Bully.Overall:  I would suggest renting, a lot of fun, but easily beaten, not worth $50
+ I just received this game yesterday and I've already put a few hours worth of time into it.  You can't help but notice the Rock star trademark graphics and intro.  Although the controls and character movements I think have improved over the  San Andreas controls and movement.  I found it challenging to balance the time in this game.  The clock moves pretty fast, and you have to run around finding challenges as well as watching the clock to make sure you aren't truant from class or trespassing at night when you're supposed to be in bed!  You also have to really watch out for the Prefects, which by the way, is the same term used in Harry Potter.  Maybe it's a British thing?  I have to disagree with the one reviewer saying that Jimmy is not a Bully.  He isn't like the other bullies, but he does have to win the respect of others (GTA style) by protecting and beating up the Bullies.  So basically Jimmy bullies the bullies.  Breaking into lockers, running errands for the underprivileged, flirting with girls, getting good grades in class, riding around on a skateboard, and one of my favorites is Dodge ball in Gym Class!  And these are all things I've come across in the first few hours of play!  What's next?  Get this game!  It's a vast array of ecliptic gaming skills and entertainment styles, you won't regret it! And if you are also looking for a completely original game, graphics like I've never seen before I noticed alto of Bully buyers get Okami, which I did also, and that is like no other game graphics-wise.  VERY artistic for those who's girlfriends get tired of watching you play the same ol.  It is pleasing to the eye.  Very artistic and original.  
- The intercooler can, and in my case did, damage my 360. It sucks current that otherwise would go to the 360, which caused component failure. The worst part? As it's not an approved accessory for the 360, any damage it causes will void your warranty and you'll have to buy a new 360 out of pocket
- I was not able to get the original intercooler to work on my system. I sent it back and got another one. The second intercooler did not work either. It makes a nice paperweight!
+ Well after all the media attention Bully has arrived. It would seem that all those nutty parental groups were wrong again. May be now they'll focus on some real problems facing our poor children. Not only did this game prove not to be a "Columbine" handbook it tries to show a better way to deal with the problems facing teens.Well the rant is over now for the rave. The game mechanics are excellent. Like many of Rock star titles they've improved on the GTA engine allowing smoother play. Stepping away from the mission types in the GTA series Bully had to have better ideas without falling back on the GTA typical wholesale killing. Now don't get me wrong I enjoy the GTA series, and most of Rock star's other releases.  I never passed shop class though. Seeing the GTA open ended engine applied to another series just shows me the various directions they can go in as far as game creation.The mini-games are fun and addictive. I wish they would have other classes represented. With Bully you get to not only play a great game, but some of us old folks will travel back to a simpler time. Overall this is an excellent game, worth your time, and a is a fine example of how stupid the media and those parental groups can be.
- There are WAY too many credible stories about these things causing problems to risk a $400 360. Putting *any* kind of power-drawing device between a piece of sophisticated electronics and its power supply is just asking for trouble -- I own a lot of expensive electronics and I'd never do it in a million years.Instead of taking such a chance, go to your local retailer and buy a little fan (4"-6") designed for placing/clipping (depending on how you've got your Xbox set up) on your desk at work, etc. You can get one for $5-$10 and don't have to worry about leeching power from your 360. Just set it up beside the 360 so that air flows beneath and over top.Since your average superstore has about a dozen fans that would fit the bill, you can shop for one that's quiet and fits your setup. My 360 actually runs quite cool, although I do have a small fan behind my audio rack that blows on my stereo amplifier.PS Always, always, always put electronics that generate heat in as open a location as possible. NEVER put anything on top, ALWAYS place on a hard surface, and ALWAYS leave at least a few inches clearance all around. Lastly, ALWAYS use a surge suppressor
- I played this game until Chapter 23. All the Dancing Levels were VERY HARD to beat! I think this game is not worth buying-- rent it
- My son begged for this game, and the price is reasonable compared to some games so we added it to our collection.  He enjoyed levels 1and2, but once we got to level 3 that was it!  Unless you have earned the nickname "Fast fingers" or "Fury Feet" don't bother purchasing this until you rent it.  I spent an hour trying to beat level 3 for my 6 year old the only thing I discovered was that I did equally as well when I randomly hit the 4 keys as quickly as possible (about 57% accurate) as I did actually keeping up.  Being this is only level 3 I can only imagine the "Dance Levels" get harder from here, Good Luck!!
+ Just to add my 2 cents to an already glowingly-reviewed title, a couple more clues as to how well-received this game was:1. After selling through the initial stock, Cap com stopped shipping copies of the game. An uproar from the gaming community ensued and existing copies started selling for 2-3 times the SRP in online auctions before Capcom announced that they will ship more copies. 2. At E3 there was a trailer revealed for a Phoenix Wright sequel on the DS, which is the sequel to the original game in Japan but will be titled in the USA as "Justice For All".If you are up for unconventionally written games with quirky charm, this is a fun title to sit back, relax and laugh with.
+ The hilarity, adventure, wit and fun of this game is nothing shy of stupendous (amazing great, marvelous).  It has a certain nostaglia to it with a new twist on the adventure/puzzle genre.  Think of all the games that consumed our time back in the day such as King's quest, Police Quest, and Leisure Suit Larry and put it to the tune of trials, evidence and investigation with hints of an RPG, text adventure and anime and you'll land on Phoenix Wright.  It's concept does seem retro but it really is like nothing you have played before.  The star of this show is Phoenix Wright, a lawyer who is new to the scene and must prove is worth with the Fey and Co law offices.  As his first case, you must take on a murder case as the defendant's lawyer.  In court, you will have prove to the court that the defendant is 'not quilt' by cross-examining witness testimonies.  Your object is to find faults and contradictions in their testimony by referencing evidence and prior statements.  You can 'press' them on everything they say to make them open up more about their testimony or to get them to confess more information.  The game doesn't stop there though, after winning your first case you will go on to also investigate the crime scenes, talk to witnesses and find your own evidence for your next case.  Think law and order but you will be handling both sides of the coin.  Sure, there is a detective but he is a bit slow witted and quick to come to mis-conclusions.  That is where you come in, to further investigate all the missing gaps that the detective doesn't fill, to use finding in the investigation to prove your defendant innocent later in court and to provide the court clarity as to what actually happened.  It plays like a puzzle/adventure in that you must find clues and evidence and present them at the correct times (to object to a testimony, prove a contradiction or to trigger an event in a investigation) in order to progress through the game.  These items are stored in your court record.  This game plays more like a interactive comic book and that is definitely not a bad thing.  Most of your time will be spent reading text, I would say this takes up 75% of the game.  This doesn't hurt the game's score any because for 1) the game has a great story and is intriguing around every corner 2) the interaction between the characters is oft times funny and not at all dry.  It reads like a quality script written for a comic book or TV show. The following 25% is interaction, the ability to choose the right option or to present evidence at the right moment of the game.  This interaction goes seamless with the story and fits appropriately with the DS.  As the stylus is greatly utilized for presenting evidence out of your court record and exploring crime scenes.  There is a good reason why this makes most people's top ten DS list.  Graphics: 3.5 out of 5.  Although this game only consist of anime-esque stylings of still life characters that are only slightly animated among st static backgrounds, the graphics still help carry the story. It looks like the makings of slightly animated, interactive comic book. The character art is well drawn and each character changes looped animations based on their current mood.  However, the graphics could easily have been shown on a lesser system such as the GBA.  Perhaps the graphics have been revamped and enhanced slightly for the DS version. The only real thing that separates it from a GBA title is its use of stylus and its length.  Sound: 4 out 5, good use of sound effects and use of music add suspense and drama to the game.Game play: 5.  Story: 5. Replay Value: 3.Overall: 4.5  A must for DS owners
- This game is a joke!  It is impossible for a child to get past level 3.  It took my husband about 20 tries to get past it, and he is a pro at video games.  (he beat me ch 2 for x-box and halo2 the third time he played them.)  Don't buy this game for your kids until you rent it and let them try it out.  It is was a waste of money my kids won't even play it.  It should be rated N for Nobody
- The game-play is just foolish and found the game annoying and un-fun!  The kids didn't even like it. Run, don't walk away from this dentist-office of a game JAWS-cr@p. (JAWS = Just another W. Smith
- my kid played the game for 5 min only, it is not fun. if you want to try it just rent I
- We have been unsuccessful with this e-reader attachment since we purchased it. Cards read once and never again. Doesn't matter if we use the GB SP or Advance. Still doesn't do anything. Don't recommend you waste your money
+ Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney is a fun game.  It's that simple.  Graphics (4 out of 5):  I would say the graphics are on par with most DS games.  They could be better, but they don't retract at all from the game-play.  They are fun and in the same style as games like Sprung and Under the Knife.Audio (2 out of 5):The audio is where most DS games fall short.  I am content with the graphic abilities of the DS, because quite simply the graphics don't make a good game.  Sure they help, but the game-play is were the entertainment truly lies.  It's knowing this that has kept Nintendo on top in the hand held market.  I just wish that the DS had a little more power behind it for the audio's sake.  I would like speaking characters throughout an entire game, especially a game like this.  And the music is so repetitive, it got to be so annoying that I found myself just turning the sound completely off.  I guess they do the best they can for what they have to work with, but in this case, it's just not good enough.Game play (5 out of 5):  As far as the game-play goes, you couldn't ask for a much better experience.  You are put in the role of Phoenix Wright who in his first trial is defending his best friend who has been accused of murdering his girlfriend.  Eventually you go on to work other cases and along the way you are required to gather evidence to use in court to supp port your defence.  The characters are over the top and a lot of fun to interact with.  This is a text based game and I suppose you might have to be a fan of the genre to really appreciate it.  But it's a simple pick up and play game that held my attention from beginning to end.  I really had trouble putting it down.  While a game like Sprung got a little monotonous and came down more to memorization then common sense questioning.  Phoenix stays on track in that area and logic plays more of a part in the solution of the cases.  I highly recommend this game!
- It's got some occasionally interesting puzzles, but the lame story and irritating characters kill whatever appeal Keepsake might have had.The Good: Unique and challenging puzzles; handy hint system helps keep the game moving.The Bad: Some of the worst voice acting you will ever hear; blurry, low-res backgrounds; dull characters and an uninteresting story
- We bought this game knowing Shrek movies are a bit raunchy, but thinking the game would be ok for a 6 year old to play.After watching my son play this game for a few minutes... I saw that he had to stun chickens and put them in a pot of boiling water while they were still alive. Then after that, he punched large turtles and threw them on tables where there backs were cracked open and died.  I can't believe a game that is rated E for Everyone would have little kids (or whoever played it) have to be so mean to animals.  What's next, ripping the head off a rabbit? I consider myself one of the coolest moms around, but this totally crossed the line
- I agree with other reviewers that the graphics and vocals are good, but I find the game-play itself less than stellar. For starters, I've always been irritated with games that don't let you save your status whenever you want. Sometimes I just want to get in a quick dose of game-play, but that's not possible with these games that require you to play through an entire section before being allowed to save.  That contributes to the repetitive, tedious nature of some sections. If you get stuck getting through a certain bit of the game, you're doomed to replay much of what led up to it over and over again.I realize that tricky camera angles are some of the challenges that are supposed to exist in this game. More than in the earlier versions, however, I have trouble getting myself lined up for whatever task. Another tedious element.I found this game to be more a test of my endurance and patience than actual fun
- I purchased this game when it was new, and my computer while meeting the requirements just couldn't run it. I put he game in a box and just a month ago found it again. The computer I have now should be able to run the game thrice simultaneously with all options on highest settings. Yet the game will randomly crash and cause my computer to restart and losing my 4Min's to 2 hours work. I contacted tech support and got what I am now sure are just something for me to try until I quit trying and leave them alone. It worked. They win. They got my money and I got jack
- The copy of SimCity4 that I purchased came without the access codes to support instillation. When I called Electronic arts all I got was an automated phone system... press 2 now... EA's manufacturing quality control is so poor that they had a selection for products without access codes! I could never find a way to talk with a human being about the problem. The automated voice suggested solution was to send the product to them at my expanse to prove that it came without the access code! I have returned the game to Amazon for a refund. I would never buy another EA product
- I bought one of these for my daughter as a gift and found that I need one for each GBA or SP.  So I bought another one for my son.  Then after we couldn't get them to work and consulted Nintendo we found that the wireless adapter doesn't work for all multi-player games and there are only a few games that will work with the wireless version.  Some gift
- I have always been a fan of fighting games.  As far as 3D ones go, I have great experience in the Dead or Alive series and proficiency with Soul Calibur 2.  I fear that Dead or Alive and Soul Calibur may have spoiled me though.  Recently I bought Mortal Kombat Deception and found it horribly awkward* compared to the fluid battles of Soul Calibur or Dead or Alive.  I felt the same way when I played Tekken 5.  Unlike the graceful and awesome animations of Dead or Alive or Soul Calibur, the movements of the characters in Tekken 5 are unrealistic and absurd.  Try out Christie in Tekken 5 for example.  Her idle animation is preposterous.  If you have access to Dead or Alive 3, try putting out Leifang.  Her idle animation is a thing of beauty.  Every one of her moves flows perfectly from one to the next.  This kind of grace is seriously lacking in the clunky Tekken 5.And now let us speak of character design.  Tekken 5's characters are boring and uninspired.  They run the gamut from miscellaneous boxer 1, 2, 3, and 4, to miscellaneous karate fighter 1, 2, 3, and 4.  Oh.  There are also a few shrieky girls in tight clothing, some of which seem to be Asian, if that's your thing.  And then there's a guy in a cat mask.  As awesome as that sounds, it looks silly in the game.If you have ever played Practice Mode on Dead or Alive you will probably recall with fondness that there is a feature that shows each move command at the top of the screen and keeps it there until you successfully perform that move.  This feature, as useful as it is, is not present in Tekken 5.  To be fair, it isn't found in any other fighting game that I have played, but it really should be.Without further ado, let me simply say that I do not recommend buying Tekken 5 if you have ever played Soul Calibur or Dead or Alive.  The intro video is about as much excitement as the game can offer (I especially enjoyed the suicidal bicycle girl that rescued the kitten).*But at least Mortal Kombat Deception had Puzzle Kombat, which rocked my socks
- Sure it looks good and the game-play is ok but the final boss (Jinpachi) is really cheap and lame! Even at the "easy" difficulty, just a couple of hits from this freak and you're dead! The Devil Within mini-game is also stupid, some levels are just impossible and too hard. I wouldn't mind it if you could save your game whenever you want to or at least just before some critical part of the game but unfortunately that is not the case here, not to mention some save points are hidden. Imagine getting through the most boring levels doing extremely tedious yet dumb puzzles, spending around 2 hours or more to get to the boss level, then finally finding yourself trying over and over to beat the boss until you just give up but you can't save your game, then you're gonna have to redo the entire level again!!! That is one sick stupid game design! The only reason I'm playing this mini-game is just to get the hidden items
+ He was exelente, but I continue insisting deveria to at least place a paguina with translation to the Spanish on the item.  Thus they tendrian but trade here in Venezuela,  without but one takes leave of you     Emerson.
+ people plz  ive had my PS2 a month after it came out ok I have had 2 controllers the ones I bought that day I play at least 8 or 9 hours during summer 4 to 5 hours a day during school year I have never had any problems at all my cousins have thrown these across the room at the wall when they get mad nothing happens these are very durable 
- At First When I Got It, It Seemed Fun.  Then As The Minutes Go By It Got Boring Quick.  The Missions Suck, The Bosses Are Too Hard.  I Just Sold My Game,  If You Buy This Game You'll Be Doing The Sam
+ I like the 05 version better. Sure this has updated playing rosters and the new quarterback function, but it doesn't appear to me EA sports have evolved much over the last 12 months or even few years for that matter. I was expecting the graphics to be better and the game-play to feel more real but maybe I was expecting too much. I won't buy the 07 when it comes out, I'll wait and see what they can do with it on PlayStation 3
- I really liked the first two Jak games, so I was excited to try Jak 3. Whoa. Major mistake. This game is nothing more than a lame racing-wannabe. I was very disappointed in this game. If you are expecting a platformer, look elsewhere
+ the good-it has fairly good graphics-the franchise is very real and you can play it up to 30 seasons. -it has a bunch of new features that madden 05 didn't like, the truck stick and nfl superstar the bad-once you've played this for awhile you'll realize that john madden and al micheals say the same thing every game. it get old. -when you look into the crowd in a game, the graphics suck. it looks like a big blob of colors overall it is a really fun game. I hope madden 07 will be better though.
- Dint get me wrong the controller is innovative and feels good and is really a grea idea but the one huge problem that none has mentioned is how these things eat up batteries, put it this way, you need to put new AA batteries in the damn thing every three days, and that is not cool at all! I will be buying the wire controllers from now on, The premium system should have included the battery charger mi other than this MAJOR ISSUE the controller is great, but again let me stress's this issue,... it is not fun to be in the middle of an online fight in Fight Night 3 and have your controller (that you just put batteries in, well at least you thought you did) die, and get you knocked out when you were clearly winning the fight
- My son (7) used a gift certificate to purchase this game for his birthday. It came with 4 dicks that we downloaded correctly but the game would not play. We kept getting an error message that our graphics were not sufficient.  We don't do much PC gaming, but we have a fairly new Dell laptop computer that we assumed was sufficient. If the item description had been more advising that certain requirements would prevent the game from working -- we wouldn't have wasted his time.  We have yet to receive credit for this item. A HUGE HASSLE!!  We'll stick to the PS2 games from now on.
+ My expertise actually is in Rpg's but I've always been a Madden fan so I think my opinion can be usefull to someone wanting to know about this game. This is your classic madden game. very fun, very addictive, and very challenging. franchise mode is the best feature. Basically you pick your team and then you decide how much to pay the players in order to keep under the salary cap, which players to dump and rehire and pretty much everything else it takes to run a team ( which is a lot of things ).             Then their is the online mode where you play players from all over the country. After you play all of the other modes this feature can keep you entertained clear until the next madden game comes out. The only problem is that some online players know how to cheat. EA sports strongly denies that it's possible to cheat online, and many good players get mad when someone talks about cheaters online because the good players think that people who blame others for cheating are just sore losers ( which is true a lot of the time ). However, after personally seeing some of the things my computer nerd brother can hack into and do I think anything is possible on any website. There are a ton of people out there that are a lot smarter than you and me and they can figure out how to cheat at anything!             Finally the only reason that made me drop my rating from a 5 star overall to a 3 star overall. The infamously not so popular superstar mode. Super star mode sucks!!!! You have to retry forever to get the pedigree parents you want. On top of that you can't fully get your player to a high rating in all the categories that make a good player ( speed, agility, strewth etc. ). You can improve the player's stats, but never to where you eventually want to get them. Also, when you finally get an agent that get's you access to the performance institute it doesn't do much good because using the performance institute only increases your stat's temporarily. But I have some good news! I've heard through the grapevine that in Madden 07 this feature will be greatly improved. You'll be able to run the 40 yard dash so you can equally get a speed rating higher than a lousy 88. You get to do the bench rep to decide your own strength. So at least in Madden 07 you'll have more control of your player's skills. This is the best thing about Madden. The people who make these Madden games must have took notes when they learned about evolution in school. Every year Madden adapts and improves the flaws in last year's game ( much like what football coaches do with their team's in real life ). The cool thing is that they actually take advice from their fan base ( Unlike most game companies ). When Madden comes across a problem they adapt and fix the problem.             This game probably deserved a 4 star overall rating instead of a 3 star overall rating, but when a video game company adds a new feature to a game it better be cool. Because it really pisses me off if they go through the trouble to add a new feature to get us all really excited and then the new feature ends up being stupid.
+ This is a very interesting game. Lots of places to explore. Game Play is pretty smooth. Sometimes a rapid-fire button will help you a lot. The game is very bookish. With no cut scenes from the movie.It can be fairly complicated at times. With some strange moves to master. Like flying shoes and umbrellas. It's a fun game with good graphics
- how many RPG's can this world make??  they're all the same.  open this container, take weapons and health kits from this dead body, use this spell.. KOTOR is no different, sadly.  the combat IMHO is just really boring.  when you see an enemy, the screen freezes and you decide ahead of time your first moves to make.  if that doesn't kill the enemy, your character automatically does standard attacks unless you pause the game and set up your next moves.  umm, how many times has this been done before?  if I wanted that, I could have bought final fantasy 129 or whatever number they're on now.  all of the enjoyment is taken out of using things like blaster rifles and light sabers.  it's the same idea as using your shovel or something in nethack (look it up).  the good thing about games like ever quest and world of Warcraft is that they took the stale old RPG formula and did something new with it. 
+ After 8 hours of play so far, I have gotten a lot more enjoyment out of this game than I did when reading the first three books of the series (which themselves probably took less than 8 hours to read).  Where shall I begin describing this really fun game?1. The characters themselves are realistically animated, and the Sunny animations are especially amusing, with the way that she bites things, squeals, does little dances, etc.  I've smiled and laughed a lot just at how well the characters were represented.2. Voices are very good, including the use of some of the major actors appearing in the upcoming film, although their use is not pervasive during normal game play.3. The scenario is great fun - far more involving than the books so far!  Playing the piano to break it apart and get it open was a real riot!!!  The settings are creepy, with little roaches crawling about, and rats and spiders and such.4. The game reaches the level of art!!  Who did the soundtrack?  The music is AWESOME and wondrous!  After the dingy mansion of Count Olaf, there are episodes of light relief that fill the player with a sense of peace and wonder - the Library scene, Uncle Monty's House and Garden.  The Garden with butterflies flapping by, grass blowing, wondrous music playing, and the Big Tree adventure with Klaus flying over the greenery, rivers, etc. finally made me see this video game as reaching a level of artistic accomplishment - like a good painting, to just get lost in and enjoy all the details and sensory input.  Wow!And at first I was concerned that I might get through the game too quickly.  After 8 hours though and only being midway through, I know I'm getting my $40 worth, for I will surely play through the whole thing more than once just as one watches a favourite video or takes a hike along a favourite forest path.  I calculate that at about $2 per hour, this game is giving a far better return than seeing the film in the theater when it comes out (although I plan to do that too).  And that's not even counting the game's resale value afterward!In addition, there are some special game features that tie in with the film - with players eventually awarded with film photos, information, A/V from and about the film...One extra note to game players is that I don't think players will get a great deal of benefit from the BradyGuide to this game.  That game guide is poorly mapped and far from comprehensive, while the instruction manual that comes in the game itself gives enough instruction and detail to allow players to start and proceed.  Save yourself $15 by avoiding the BradyGuide, because a map you make yourself while playing will likely be far more useful.  Halfway through the game so far, I only got about two useful tips from that guidebook, and I would have figured those clues out on my own anyway..
- I bought this because the two Dino Crisis games on the PlayStation 1 were fantastic survival horror fun, and I was very taken with the hype around this game which billed it as a lightgun game that was free roaming rather than on rails. What they didn't say was that it's almost impossible to use the PS2 gun as a fully functioning controller, which is what you really need to do. For anything but shooting, all the buttons you need are in really inconvenient places all around the gun and after half an hour's play time, I had to take a break to rest my aching joints.In case you haven't seen it, the G-Con2 gun has a teeny-weeny directional pad on the back of it, and it's this that you are expected to use to move yourself around. Now, if you try holding the gun in a standard "aiming" style, you'll soon realise that your fingers are in nowhere near the right position to be able to reach it. You could just hold the gun wrongly and reach it, but you need to be able to fire at the screen regularly to kill dinosaurs. And they don't sit still waiting to be shot! So for most of the game you need to be able to move and fire at the same time. And guess what? It's impossible. Bravo, Capcom. Oh, sorry, they didn't stop there, but added a further control scheme to allow you to strafe. To do this you need still more fingers so that you can still press the directional pad, along with two further buttons way down on the gun barrel at the same time. And be able to pull the trigger. But even that's the end of it - if you want still more pain, try using sniper mode! As you may have realized, the control scheme completely spoiled the game-play for me. I'm not fumble-handed by any means, but you would need to be an octopus to manage all this. Which is a shame, because a free-roaming game about shooting dinosaurs is a very exciting idea. And Dino Stalker is otherwise presented very well. The graphics are very good and the monsters all look very impressive. Some stages are really good fun but my favourite ones are those when you are riding some kind of vehicle, which means you don't have to worry about movement at all - hooray! The levels where you get chased down a tunnel by an enraged T-Rex are probably the most fun in the game. The rest is ruined by the controls, which make your life hell. I'll tell you something else too - most levels have a TIME LIMIT!! In case you thought a slow careful hunt would save your fingers, this has been rendered an impossibility by the levels having a clock that counts down to zero - so if you don't rush through the stage, it's game over for you. Kind of negates the joy of free-roaming, doesn't it? You are basically stuck with dashing from point A to point B, killing everything that moves...might as well be on rails. I don't know why this stupid condition was added, as Dino Stalker was not created to be an arcade game.It's a real waste of potential, but it's only fitting that Dino Stalker was a miserable failure after release. If you buy it, you have only yourself to blame. I managed to finish it - the final stage in the volcanic pit was actually pretty good fun, but this and the other bosses towards the end were endurance tests that caused me agonizing hand cramps to get through. Save yourself - I made it through so that I could come here and tell you that you don't have to. Could have been a great game, but it all went wrong due to the impossible way you are expected to be able to use the gun.
- I really wanted to see how the developers could represent playing as a dragon, and spyro is the only one that came to mind at the time.  I decided to get it, I put it in my console, turned it on, and was blown away...by the stupidity.-Basic StoryIs stupid.  Bad dragon plant mean gems to kill good dragon.  Spyro good dragon, defeat evil dragon.  Everybody dances because goodness prevailes.-GameplayAn atrocious story can be overlooked if the game-play is good (mario?) but spyro has probably the worst game-play ever.  It combines horrible, precise jumping puzzles with abysmally stupid enemies.  The puzzles require you to tap the jump button at a certain time.  If you don't, you go back to the beginning of the puzzle.  It was maddeningly hard at some points, and I am grown.  So how hard would it be for a kid?For the enemies, they should get the darwin award.  At many instances I was breathing flame (it has a limited reach) and the enemy walked right into it!  The enemies are dumber then a retarded 4 year old but margianally smarter than Paris Hilton.  Also, they are very weak dying in 1-2 hits.  There are also very few types of enemies (like around 2-6) but they have the same AI and equally pose no challenge, seeing as they are weak and attack you one at a time.The boss battles are so simple they make you want to shoot yourself at how moronic they are.  Also, playing as the other characters (hunter, blinx etc.) are not that fun.In conclusion don't make the mistake I made and steer clear of this game.  Get better ones for yourself whomever you are giving a gift to. (Oh, and don't listen to the other people who gave this crudhole good reviews, they are either A. Retarded or B. Never played a decent game.
- I am a huge spyro fan, I have been playing since the first one, which was great, the second one better, the third one, ok, forth one What happened!! this one, after purchasing mine from amazon cheaply for something like Z5 I regret doing so, it was a waste of money seen as the whole game is a bit repetative and frustrating, you never seem to get anywhere. all the voices have changed. if you are a series gamer and enjoyed the origional spyro games, don't buy this and don't be disappointed. however I would say that if you are under 12 you would probably very much enjoy the game
- Don't be fooled by the advertisements that you see in almost every magazine.  Blitz doesn't offer the career mode that it was based around and game play itself is horrible.The greatest inconvenience of the game is the load times.  They are WAY too long. Loading up your profile is an inconvenience, loading up to play the game gets annoying and when you finish a game and go to save, you start to think "F*ck this".  The loading time alone will kill the feeling of wanting to play. Then there is the game-play itself.  Bone crushing hits?  Please, outside of the occasional dirty hit (which is far easier for the computer to employ on you, than vice verse) the hits look like the early developments of Madden.  The plays are fairly easy until you get to the 4NH Carter when it seems that everytime the computer magically can score 21 points no matter what defensive strategies you employ.  Then there is the whole steriods issue which is laughable.  Give a player some juice and he misses 3 plays.....conventionally treat him and he misses a gator.  Either way, you'll never miss him.This game is horrible, from the graphics to the load times.  Save your money and go buy a game that will at least remotely capture your interest
- This game was a really big disappointment for me.  I had to try this game because of all the hype and all the reviews here.  Having played the Nintendo 64 game titled Mario Kart 64 I felt like it was not much of an improvement.  In fact, I feel that Mario Kart 64 was a better game.  The only improvement was in the graphics.  Still, why do the characters not have fingers?  In this stage of the game you would think that they would have fingers by now.  Anyway, after I played the game I played a bit cheated.  I was bored by it within ten minutes.  The game is supposed to shine with multi-player but it fizzled.  There are so many GameCube racing games out there that are so much better than this game at a much lower price.  One example of a better combat racing game is Burnout.  If you can get any one of the games in this series you will see what a good combat racing game feels like.  I feel that Mario Kart Double Dash!! is a dumbed down version of Mario Kart 64.  I so much wanted it to be a great game.  It no longer has the hopping ability of the previous game.  For me it just wasn't very good.  Double Dash!! probably would be better for very young gamers as they would probably be more forgiving of its shortcomings
- This game came highly recommended by people who generally have similar taste in games as me, but I'm still trying to figure out why. There's no question that the in-game graphics are impressive and the story-line is interesting. However the game-play is nearly non-exist ant, and when you do happen to participate in some of the action the controls are either badly executed or unnecessarily complicated (I.e. the sphere grid or blitz ball). Even the story is often poorly told, with stilted voices and hilariously bad character animation.If I had to compare this game to some of Squaresoft's other efforts, it is similar to a mix between Final Fantasy 8 and Chrono Cross. But while those two games were generally frowned upon by RPG enthusiasts, Final Fantsy X has recieved almost universal praise. In short, I'm not so much disappointed with the game as I am baffled by its warm reception.
+ I love this game.  I haven't played other DDR games before, so I'm not sure how it compares to others, but this one is great.  Some of the songs I like a lot, and some I don't, but they're all a challenge and fun in some way.  I like to use the Dance Master mode in which you have to unlock songs by doing well.  I haven't made it all that far because I play the same levels over and over again because they're so fun.  This game is great for people of all ages, and includes music for the young and old. 
+ If you want to workout at home, want it to be fun, and already have a PS2, I would recommend this video game
+ I've been a GTA fan for a few years now and to me, San Andreas has got to be the best one. For the first time you can swim!! I fell into the water accidental and discovered this new action for the character. The graphics are more real making it kind of "funky" controlling the game but after awhile you'll get used to it. The language is terrible (more so in this GTA version) so young kids should avoid this like the plague.
+ There's a reason everyone loves this game- there's a lot of exciting action!  The popularity of this game is well-deserved too, because you can do so many things in this game that it's almost ridiculous.  Driving around is a blast, and the many weapons you can use such as shovels, baseball bats, golf clubs, pistols and shotguns truly makes this one incredibly fun and revolutionary game.  It's a game you have to own if you're a fan of video games. 
+ Whatever product Sony brings to the market, you can always be sure that you are buying a Top Quality Product, and these Sony memory card for PS2 is just the perfect exam pl
+ In late 04 I decided to give in and purchase THE gaming system at the time that was the original Xbox.  Having not been a real dedicated gamer previously and only played on (and never owned) systems I had little knowledge of how it'd be upon use--but since Halo 2 had just been released to rave reviews I knew I had to try it out (hey, it's HALO, people!).  Man, I was glad I invested in it!  It's a bit large (compared to my best friend's PS2) and is a bit difficult to lug someplace, but the graphics are much better than the PS2 and the games available for it are great (significantly the critically acclaimed Halo series, of course, THE best game out there in my opinion).  There are some issues with how bulky the system is but it's about the quality of gaming rather than how bulky a gaming system is
+ "Dude Supy" gave this game a bad review.  "Supy" is likely 20-years old with an advanced palette for video games.  It is best suited for children 6-12, like my two children who are big fans of the Lemony Snicket movie.  The game follows the movie pretty closely, the graphics are pretty good, and if you're not a very skilled gamer (like my 6-year old) it's okay because if you "die" you just restart the task.  I have a few technical complaints, but this game definitely lives up to my 5-star rating
+ Book Fans: Don't listen to "Dude Supy," because he most likely hasn't read the books.  This game is very fun, but doesn't last very long at all.  If you like the books, you should rent it.  You probably won't want to buy it, though.  I rented it yesterday and beat it today.  Very fun, but not for long
+ I was quite unsure on whether to buy the film or not as I didn't think it was going to be my type of film. But I bought the game anyway although I hadn't yet seen the film. Anyway mi glad I did! It only took me two days to complete but although it isn't long long, it is very good from beginning to end, basically going round different rooms of the house doing different things which may seem boring, actually it is really fun! The activities etc are great! it is definitely a good game if you like the more adventurous games that aren't too hard, like me, too hard games aren't really my type! Now I so cant wait to see the film which I recently bought
- I bought this game on a whim, having really liked Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2. This game needs help. First of all, the frame rate is lower than it should be. There is slow-down as well. Even the game before this, Need For Speed: Underground 2 looked 100 times better. The car models in Most Wanted are a touch nicer-looking and there is a far better selection than Underground 2, but that's the only plus this game has to it. You don't race as much as fly around the city in a barely-controlled frenzy, trying to stay ahead of the computer cars. Winning is more by luck than skill. He or she who hits the least obstacles wins. Hardly an enjoyable way to race! I get too stressed when playing this game, so I put it away for a while. Definitely rent before buying this game.
- I started with Caesar2 back when it came out. I played it for hours and hours and loved it. When Caesar3 came out I bought that too and loved it even more and spent even more time playing. Both Caesar2 and 3 rarely crashed. Things have changed!I'm spending more and more of my time restarting Caesar4 than I am playing it. About 8 out of 10 times that I access the area where you trade with other cities it crashes. Without trading, you make little money and the game is essentially over.Other problems I'm seeing is overall performance. I don't have the fastest machine (AMD 2.1ghz, 512ram, rock in' video card with 256meg of mem) but there are irritating 1 second delays in addition to the crashes. I find the whole game to be difficult to use. This was not the case with Caesar3.Unless they issue a patch, I'm done feel frustrated with crashes. Maybe I can dumb down the graphic setting to get rid of the delays.My suggestion? Wait for a patch before buying --- or move on.- json
- Well, it sounds like a great game, but after five hours of upgrading and downloading all of the specified programs and upgrades, I couldn't get the video to work at all, couldn't get technical support at all, and I gave up and have returned it to the manufacturer. a great disappointment because I love and still play the previous versions
- As others have said, this was a much-anticipated game. I played Caesar II and III and was extremely excited when I heard that IV was coming out. What a let-down! I didn't have any of the installation errors that others have mentioned, and I haven't had the game crash on me. However, the game is unplayable on my system - which is only a year old - unless I turn down 90% of the advanced graphics. By "unplayable", I mean ten seconds or more of waiting between the time you click with your mouse, and when the game responds. Even with the graphics turned down, I still get lag when the auto-save starts. As mouse-control is essential when building roads or aquaducts, this is aggravating in the extreme.It appears that Sierra's programmers and designers put a lot of work into upgrading the graphics. Too bad I can't see them!The interface is horrible and takes up the right half of the screen at 1280x1024 resolution. This means that you must rotate the map to build along the right edge. I much prefer the "tabbed" building interface of the other city-building games.Although you can build roads along the diagonals in this game - which you couldn't in earlier versions - the interface is not smart enough to auto-rotate the buildings to fit along the roads. You have to click and drag to rotate buildings, and lag - even at the low graphics settings - can make this an exercise in frustration.I dislike the new warehouse management panel. The sliders might look cool, but they're slow (lag!). I would've liked to see additional options for "only store basic goods", "only store luxury goods", etc. This would take some of the pain out of managing them. Trade ports are different also - you can't see prices!It appears that some of the scenarios have hidden milestones that you have to meet in order to advance. In the one I'm playing right now, I'm stuck because my prosperity rating will not rise above 36 (50 required to win). I have over 30,000 denarii in my treasury, and have been turning a hefty profit (and meeting various demands from Rome) for at least eight years of game-time. I have met and exceeded all other requirements for victory, but prosperity continues to elude me. My city is almost completely automated by now - the only thing I do is respond to Rome's requests for goods or cash. My advisors have nothing helpful to say. It's not fun if I can't advance.So while the game is pretty - from what I can see of it - it's got too many frustrations to be worth much more of my time
+ All the family have played this game and have had a blast, Sorry you have to use your brain to play this one kids. The graphics are great and the puzzle solving is fun. We also own the movie
+ I can't believe someone would try selling a memory card for more than 25 dollars.  You are being ripped off if you have to pay more than 10 dollars for one, but unfortunately, if you live in the country like me, finding a store nearby selling Playstation 2 memory cards would probably be nearly impossible.  So you're forced to shop for one online.It's REALLY not cool to have to pay all this money *just* to save the progress in my video game.  It's really dumb. 
- First thing-the graphics are far prettier than any of the current 3 Caesar games out there.  Having said that-this game had a major bug right at the release.  How is that possible?  Is it unreasonable to expect a U.S. company to produce a flawless product?  Probably not, but Tilted Mill has some of the the best pros in the industry.  Basic bugs killed any enjoyment for me and the scenario editor is an unworkable mess. The advice offered by the techno weenies on the forums are beyond comprehension of the average consumer.  Far better to go with CivCity 3
+ There are a lot of different memory cards on the market for the PS2,but the official Sony 8mb memory card is by far the best card for your system.Unlike other memory cards available,this baby will not fail you.That means you can depend on it at all times.So to make a long story short,do yourself a favor and buy this ever-reliable memory card.
+ This memory card holds enough game files for any gamer to use but it is way overpriced. I didn't have to worry about this because mine came with my PS2. It can hold about 40 files, thats about 1 file for each game. If you have over 40 games, like me, you should consider getting the value pack that comes with 2 memory cards. If you buy two of the black ones, it will be very expensive and you will get the two memory cards confused. The value pack is a pretty good deal and you get a red and a blue memory card so its less confusing.
- This one turned out badly and I hate to say I bought it.  Buggy worse than normal, it is a rough game.  The fact that another patch is not yet available is terrible. The support site blames your system or card but offers no practical solutions. Too bad. I trusted PC Game's review and it is the first time they let me down but they have adapted more of a partnership with the game companies now and a liberal grading program that passes more stinkers. Do not buy this game...even when working it is not but a bargain bin game
- she is just right for me I know mi a little to hot for her but I think wed make Hollywood's cattiest couple
+ This game I purchased for my sons. They both told me they enjoyed this game. A little tough at first but with any new game, you have your challenges. If you want a game that is not too easy, this is the one! Have fun and don't let losing take the fun away. It is a game to be played and it will en hence your skills
- Please Sid -- with the disappointment of Civ IV, and now Railroads, say you haven't jumped on the "easy" bandwagon like so many other game designers.Sid -- the reason we purchase these games is because YOUR name is on them. This game seems like it was made for a 12 year old, not someone who's grown up with the complexities you normally build into your games.Please -- the next game you release, make sure it lives up to the standards YOU created. After this, just throwing your name on a game no longer means you will print some money for your bank account
+ After finishing both "Half Life Episode I" and "The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay" over a few days, I was looking for another fun first person shooter game that would let me pass away an hour or so a day, and allow me to unwind by slaughtering a constant flow of enemies with high powered weapons without resulting in the actual murder of innocent people. I'd heard that "Far Cry" was pretty good, so I bought it, installed it and got ready to blast.The first thing I noticed is the astonishing graphics engine. It's without a doubt the most beautiful environment ever created for an FPS. My jaw was on the floor for the first few hours, checking out the ridiculously high detailed environment. The outdoor scenery looks like a paradise holiday destination with crystal clear blue water and lush green jungle. There is birdlife, fish and a general feeling that you're running around a living, breathing world.One thing was very different right from the start and would play a major role in later missions. There is no save game option! There are checkpoints littered around the levels, but it can occasionally be around 10 to 20 minutes of solid game-play between them. At first this just annoyed me since I found myself reloading over and over on some of the harder missions. I couldn't just run into the fray, firing my weapon left, right and centre at anything that moves because one head shot would send me back a heck of a long way in some instances. I was forced to change my style of play from all out assault, to a stealthy, crawling, breath-holding, sweating, nerve wracking approach. I rediscovered the part of myself that loved "Thief: The Dark Project" so very much all those years ago. Yet I still got to combine that approach with levels of general carnage when it was simply unavoidable. I am now a firm believer that the save game option should be removed from many other (not all) first person games out there as it raises the intensity level dramatically.The story itself is fairly average and the dialogue even more so, which is really what places "Far Cry" below the likes of "Half Life". You are basically just following instructions the entire game, used as a violent killing machine with no real choices. But for some reason, I just didn't care as I was so absorbed by the surroundings and simply surviving that it didn't lower my enjoyment. The enemies have very good AI, flanking me whenever possible and generally actually trying to avoid being shot rather than running straight at me. There are plenty of occasions though where an enemy will just stand there in the distance while you shoot them from plain sight, but generally all is good. The weapons are fantastic being both highly effective and satisfying to use. The sniper rifle as always is a personal favourite and this game makes awesome use of it, with massive maps of open ground.While initially I was prepared for a standard "Serious Sam" type of game, "Far Cry" turned out to be so much more. Some fantastic graphics, inspired level design, forced variations of play and some fiercely intense gunfights make this game an absolute winner. You can add value for money as well since there are 20 long missions to get through. With no save option, those 20 will take you a long time to complete. But you will love it! I sure did
+ Neat game but I shouldn't have any trouble killing a couple wolves at level 20.  The 'leveling system' developer should have stayed off the crack pipe.Also I'm the 'Hero of Kavatch' but I don't want to be reminded of it every 6 seconds.  The fact that I saved a town also apparently doesn't entitle me to even pick up an item if I don't own it w/o being thrown in prison.  Very realistic
- This game is in such a sorry state that I don't even know where to begin.First of all, this is not at all what I expected and what I wanted. Sid is known for very complex simulations and I pre ordered this game only because I saw his name as the game designer. Alas, the game is the most dumbed down train simulation I had ever seen. Looks like Sid jumped in the "easy, fast and easy" bandwagon.Second, the game is, at best, barely out of beta - a little more useful and less destructive than, say, a computer virus. I experience frequent crashes and the AI often builds ridiculous tracks.Finally, be aware that the game has one of the worst copy protection systems I had ever seen, which interferes with other applications. For instance, the game won't launch while I run Skype.Selling a game in such an unfinished state shows lack of ethics and disrespect for the customer. Shame on you, Firaxis and Sid Meier.
+ My son loves this game! We rented it first from Blockbuster and now he won't let us take it back, so I ordered it from Amazon.com so I can take the game back soon to Blockbuster! I have to help him through some of the areas, like when the penguin is fishing, but I don't mind because it's FUN
+  Dawn of Souls for my Game boy Advance(Hey, if you're going to collect a series, it's a good thing to start at the beginning) at my local video game store but they only had Final Fantasy IV Advance so I decided to get it instead. There isn't much that I can say that hasn't already been said by the other reviewers here about Final Fantasy IV Advance.The story goes like this..The kingdom of Baron is on a quest to collect all the elemental crystals. The commander of its air force, Cecil, has been dismissed after questioning the king's motives. With the help of others; Cecil sets out to stop the growing threat and, in the meantime, uncovers a far more dangerous one. It's a deep story with alto of twists and turns and is a deeply challenging game due to the Active Time Battle system. I can't recommend this game enough. It's one of my all-time favourite Final Fantasy games. Although they tweaked the graphics, translation and whatnot abit, they pretty much made the game as it was originally. I think Final Fantasy fans as well as casual RPG gamers will really enjoy this one.
- I waited months for this game to come out. I can't add anymore than what has been said by others. I wonder how "hands on" Sid was with it. Could be a long time before any great train game will be coming out, if ever
- Sid Meier's reputation was unblemished after the Civil War series, Civilization and the original releases of Railroad Tycoon. But this game release is a major setback that will make me hesitate about any future products carrying his name.This is a major derailment. It is the fastest that I have ever firmly known that a new game was being removed from my hard drive. Take a look at how many used copies are already flooding the market and this game just released less than two weeks ago.Every aspect is made into chewing gum where you were used to having steak. There is no expansion, tweak, or update that can fix how seriously dumbed down this version is
+ Here is a blast of nostalgia for your Gameboy Advance. Final Fantasy IV Advance aka Final Fantasy II aka Final Fantasy IV Hard-Type is a treat for old-school RPG players. Back in its hayday, Final Fantasy IV was the gold standard for what an RPG should be. The first in a series of remakes of that wonderful streak that was the SNES Final Fantasies, Final Fantasy IV is back and better than ever. The story is as good as it ever was. Final Fantasy 4 did what Final Fantasy 2 (Japanese numbering) tried to do: mixed a well developed story with memorable characters with good if simple game-play. This is the story of Cecil the Dark Knight who renounces his loyalty to the corrupt kingdom of Baron. Baron has been making war against the other nations of the world to capture four elemental crystals. When his king commands him to kill the innocent, Cecil sets out on a quest to make things right that will take him around the world, to the center of the earth, and to the moon. As he unravels the mystery of who is really behind the actions of Baron, he is joined by a cast of over ten playable characters. Each of them has a reason to join the fight. Characterization may not seem much by today's standards, but this game was made in an age when Square believed less was more. You revealed a motive once and then you moved on instead of going over and over the same psychological problem again and again. Unlike the PlayStation port that had absolutely no upgrades beyond its retranslated script, FF4Advance has a few minor visual tweaks. Some of the game sprites seem to have been tweaked abit to have more definition and character portraits have been redrawn and put in the dialogue boxes to indicate who is speaking. Most of the new portraits are fairly close to the old ones, Edge's and Rydia's are actually an improvement, but the new one's for Rosa, Paladin Cecil, and Edward in particular aren't so nice to look at. There are also two new dungeons and the ability to tackle the final boss with any of the other (still living) playable characters than with the fixed party of five like in the original. All of these new features are very unobtrusive so you can take advantage of them if you'd like the extra challenge or ignore them altogether. Instead of using the script from the original release that contained numerous spelling and grammatical mistakes and was censored due to Nintendo of America's then extremely strict guidelines, FF4A contains a more accurate revamped version. Of course, the "You spoony bard" line has, thankfully, been left intact. It's a classic.If not for one issue I'd say that this is undoubtedly the best version of the game available. Final Fantasy IV was a really hard game. FF4A is not that hard at all- at least early in the game. I don't know if the difficulty was scaled back because they thought that people didn't want to waste GBA battery life on hours of leveling up or because I've played this game many times before, but it just seemed too easy. Anyone whose played it when it first came out should remember at least super tough boss battle be it Baigan, the Magnus Sisters, Evil Wall or something else. This time through they where like a cake walk. Also it seems that the Active Time Battle is set up in such a way as it gives your party the advantage. Your party seems to regain their turns twice as fast as the enemy. About half-way through the game, that legendary difficulty starts creeping back and by the final trek to the core of the moon you'll be thankful for any break the game will give you.    Final Fantasy IV shows in this port that it stands the test of time. Instead of feeling hoary, old, and outdated, it feels just as much fun as it was fifteen years ago.
- This so called game has a very good story and plot. It keeps your attention, by making you want to see what happens next. However, the game-play could not satisfy an 8 year old. Why you ask? Because there is none. You watch 15 minutes of cinematics and then are pretty much told what you have to do. There is really not much thought needed since you are pretty much led directly to where you have to be or the object you need. Oooooh. there are multple endings. Whoopee! You still have to sit through a majority of the same cinematics and virtually do nothing. Out of the 5 or 6 hours spent playing this game through the first time, I would estimate that I only needed the controller in my hand for 30 minutes. This makes for a good movie but don't buy it if you actually like to PLAY your games instead of watch them
- ok, most people have more then one system, I have a PS2 which plays copies, and the 360, hmmmmmmmmmm should I pay so much money for the 360 version????????? or should I go for the free copy I can download for the PS2?some people might say better graphics..hmmmmmmmmmm. don't care and many don
- Easy...Boring...Bugs, bugs, bugs, glitches, glitches, glitches...Question??? Is this a new game, or possible bonus maps from CoD2 that they decided to make into a new game to profit more money????  Hmmmm??? The positive?? You can cook your grenades now. I like mine medium rare... Possibly useful in online matches, as apposed to CoD2 where you couldn't and it was point less to throw a grenade in online matches because you knew where it was and could just move. But I will never know, because I "thankfully" rented the damn thing, and didn't buy it. Wait, I didn't my dad did, on a free rental from Blockbuster. So they didn't get any of my hardly earned money. Good for me...Also could anyone tell me why I kept getting stuck on walls, tanks, people, just about everything. I think I was stuck in the air... If you like this game, you need to get the F**k out, and buy something else to play, that I have so I can meet up with you and beat you... Also, if you don't like my run on sentences you can.... Yep you guess it... Get the f**k out.
+ When I heard that Square was going to remake Final Fantasy IV (originally Final Fantasy II in the U.S.) I was very excited. This game is considered to be one of the greatest Final Fantasy games of all time. All in all I would recomend this game to anyone who is a Final Fantasy fan
- Seriously....I was waiting quite awhile for this game to come out because its predecessor is freakin sweet.  It was all I use to play online.  After purchasing this game and playing it for all of 10 minutes I quietly put it back in the box and have not taken it out since.  Online play was non existent.  Everytime I clicked on a game it said it didnt exist.  It was ridiculus.  Letting someone else create this game instead of Infinity Ward was a giant mistake.  This latest edition adds nothing to the series.  Do not purchase this game....there are many better games out there
+ Half-Life made its debut in 1998, and it shocked the entire world. Half-Life at the time featured stunning graphics, game-play, and sound. It was simply one of those games that had to be in every gamers hands, and still to this date Half-Life is a game that every action-game developing company carefully needs to study in order for their games to be a success. Shortly after the release and once the gasp from the world has ended, two game developers joined together to create a game that not gasped the world again, but made it scream.The game pits terrorists and counter-terrorists in a fast-paced sort of "S.W.A.T." type of tactical firefighting game-play. Matches can consist of one of two types of game types. The first and probably the most popular type is bomb defusal. In both of the game types, you can win by either eliminating the opposing team or following the objective. In bomb defusal a random player on the team will receive the bomb each round. The player can plant the bomb in one of two bomb spots or simply drop the bomb for another teammate to pick it up and use it. Once the bomb is planted the counter-terrorists must defuse it regardless if the terrorists have been eliminated. The counter-terrorists usually have about thirty-five seconds to defuse the bomb and win the round. The second type of game-play is hostage rescue. The terrorists must protect four hostages in an area of the map from the counter-terrorists rescuing them and taking them to their base. If the hostages are killed by the terrorists or counter-terrorists, nothing will happen except that now the counter-terrorists must completely kill the terrorists to gain victory in the round. At the start of each round all players have a few seconds to quickly buy weapons with the money they have achieved from past rounds by victories. Both teams have a significant difference in the arsenal of weapons you can choose from, but neither really focuses on a specific time of gun style. All of the weapons in the game are one-hundred percent realistic and deadly as in reality. This is an element that makes Counter-Strike such a superior game. Counter-Strike is without argument the most popular online action game in the world. An entire culture has formed around it. So what makes it such an extremely addictive and popular game? It is purely because of the fantastically well-crafted game-play and not the graphics, or the game would not be as popular as it is. Players around the world will give you many "deep" reasons why it is such a great game. But one without argument stands out. It is simply the fact that versus other games, it is "difficult" to make a kill in the game. What makes the game so addicting is the pleasure of killing someone after a long thirty second gunfight or a quick shot to the head, knowing that the dead player is now experiencing some form of anger as he waits out the rest of the round. Another element is how realistic the guns feel in the game. Regardless if they are fake and the shooting has been totally simulated, it has been superiorly well done. And definitely once a new player to the game has gained enough experience to achieve kills at least periodically, a feeling of "power" will be experienced when holding an AK-47 or an M4. The game is quite punishing to new players, and a total hapzard to players who have never played first-person shooters or video games at all. But regardless the stress you feel at first, there is absolutely no reason to put down the game because of the entry-difficulty, as it is almost guaranteed you will get better in the game.There are over ten maps in the game, and each one has been done as a masterpiece. All of the maps wildly differ from each other in the feel of action and even the environment. The most popular of all the maps, de_dust2 that has been created by DaveJ, is still commonly referenced in many gaming parodies, magazines, shows, etc. Due to its style and simplicity, it is a godly-designed map and arguably the most popular map in first-person shooter history. One thing that helps to fight a player of being bored of the game is simply the maps. Since each map has been superbly designed, a player could easily switch to another one after being bored and continue on with play, and with a different feel. The game also has many public map editors which 3rd parties can use to create custom maps. fy_iceworld and awp_map are some very popular maps that have been created by amateur designers. This makes Counter-Strike a game with an almost "infinite" value sort of feel. The sound in Counter-Strike is absolutely insanely-realistic. The first time a player plays or even watches another player play the game, the person will definitely without a doubt notice the clear sounds of AK-47 fire or pistol fire. Not much is known why the guns sound so realistic, and the player's best guess is that the designers have actually recorded live gunfire of the weapons. The sound of the weapons combined with the look and feel; end up making the player totally immersed into the game and with a feeling of "power". This sort of thing is extremely rare in video game. At the time Counter-Strike had simply jaw-dropping graphics. Created all from the Half-Life engine, players were amazed at the lighting effects and how clear the textures were. At the present, the game doesn't hold the same, but it is what in the past has mattered. Half-Life was one of the first games in history to have some slightly complex and dynamic physics. The bouncing of a flashbang or a player being blown away was also something at the time to look at. Games before the release of Half-Life hardly had any sort of physics, and if they did, it would be something very basic. Counter-Strike is a game that without argument should be on any player's hard drive. There are still even thousands of players that since from the release of the game back at 1998, still actually play the game without losing an ounce of boredom. Counter-Strike will forever be played, and is the heart of all action games from the past, present, and the future.
+ Ok look, although this is a old game, it is one of the most popular Fps(First person shooter) games out there. Ive played this for atleast 5 years now, and my friends that I know still play cs today, like myself. From planting bombs to rescuing hostages, you'll find this game enjoyable. There are lots of custom made maps out there that can bring boardness from official maps, to playing this game 24/7. The screenshots and trailers could even grab your attention, espicially the clan trailers. If your looking for a great fps game, this is it. =
- I had such high expectations for this game just to have them shot down. The single player game is fine with some dumb things with the enemy AI. The muliplayer is a joke! Well first you have to get online which is basically impossiable. The Multi-Player which was the best part of 2 is totally stupid and WORTHLESS in 3. One you can play by yourself. Sounds like fun right? two you have to drive the tank unless you are the second person to the tank but you cant just use the machine gun which u can in the other vehciles stupid. Three there are some stupid errors in a bunch of levels where you can get stuck and have to respawn yourself. I say rent it before you buy it
- My friends and I had high hopes for this game.  We played COD2 multi-player every week and were excited about a new shooter.  After playing COD3 for a few rounds we  decided to put 2 back in.  The graphics are great, but we found a lot of bugs.  There were some shading problems with the helmets that made them turn white at a certain distance.  That's fine if you want to be a UN soldier, but not if you're trying to sneak up on somebody.  Muzzle flashes were almost none existent.  No blood splash like in COD2.  The single player game isn't too bad so far, but if you plan on multi-player I would recommend renting it first.  We were of the opinion that the game was rushed, maybe they'll patch it
+ In the April 2005 PC Gamer magazine, it showed the top 50 computer games of all time. Half-Life was #1. This is basically a sequel to that game. VERY fun, except when you're in a server with hackers in it. Just make sure to never give your CD key out and to go to steampowered.com and download steam to play it (For version 1.6). Then go to Browse games and register your CD key. Once you do that, you won't be getting as much sleep as you had the past few years
+ I always hear these things, mainly of the point that it's unrealistic, noone uses teamwork, people are too preoccupied with their stats, etc, etc.  THAT may be true on many public servers, though there are quite a few that aren't filled with morons, and actually have people who play in a teamlike fashion, and complete their objective over killing off the enemy in the time given.  I am one of those people who actually go for the objective.  And actually, I am an admin at a server, and if a terrorist is last, and  is camping out the round, then I will slay him and warn him to stay on task.     Onto another point- many people claim this to be so unrealistic, it may be true on points like the M249 being a slow shooter, very cumbersome, and has too good aim for standing up, and the fact that you die from 2 shots in the toe with the AWP- those are all unrealistic points, BUT if you think about it, how much fun would it be to have to unload 5 clips and a half to killt he enemy? *COUGH HALO COUGH* yes, I just insulted halo, because the enemies are too damn strong, it drives me crazy, along with the multi-player being so annoying that you shoot the enemy with 3 shots from a sniper to kill...   And my final point is that there are people who aren't just preoccupied with their stats, there are servers dedicated to having fun- Yes, fun, on a counterstrike.  They will have a whole slew of crazy maps, ways to make it even more insane, and things such as that.  If you are interested in that try custom map servers.  ALL-IN-ALL    This game is at a peak of perfection- not even mentioning the huge amounts of customization involved in this game, from weapons to player models
- This extension cable did not work with my standard Microsoft S Controller.  Unless you still use the old monster-sized XBox controller, these cables are worthless
+ This game looks like so much fun! I mean, seriously, who wouldn't want to play as Shamu and swim around and stuff? I am very disappointed in the lack of screenshots and videos, I really think this game has potential. I've been a huge fan of Shamu ever since I was a little kid. Every summer when me and my family go to San Diego on vacation we always go and see him. I have at least ten Shamu stuffed animals on my bed. Anyways, I'm really looking forward to this game. Think about it, how many games allow you to go underwater and swim around as a creature that's home is the deep blue sea? None. With this game, I won't have to get my stuffed animals all wet when I take them in my bath with me and play around. Now if I want to pretend to be Shamu all I have to do is turn on my Gamecube! Ya see, if this game is advertised correctly it will definitely be one of the best games of the year. We need to spread the work about this
+ There's a lot of different opinions of Madden NFL 07 swirling around so I figured I get in on it as well. For my money, to just have a new football game is worth it. Seeing as how Madden is now the only football game available from year to year, if you don't like Madden's brand of video games then I feel so sorry for you. However, I think this is a great installment. By no means is this the best released but there's no doubt that it's a lot of fun.Have Madden 06? You basically have 07. Not a lot has changed from last year. The few things are the running options (juking and whatnot) being moved to the right joystick, the 50 yard dash on the training camp, and the new camera angle for your Superstar linebacker. Also, while I've only played a quarter of an exhibition game and a lot of Superstar games, I still have yet to hear John Madden. I don't know if he's not on this game or not, but if he isn't that just makes no sense.Pros:It's still MaddenLinebacker viewOverall Superstar: Hall Of Fame featureHaving all the big name rookies is kind of niceCons:It hasn't changed much from last yearYeah, that's my only big complaint. I can't help but love this game though. If you're looking to save money then there's no huge reason to buy this unless you HAVE to play with Leinart, Young, Bush, and Williams, then by all means check this out. However, if not having those guys doesn't bother you then you really don't need this year's game
- This game was originally released for 10 dollars. Almost everything about it is pulled straight from Diablo and is not quite as good. Though this game has a few things about it that are interesting, and can be enjoyable to some people, I would just skip this game and go for Diablo 2
+ I liked this game especially with Kris Kristofferson doing Ned's voice...(Should have had more of him in it)  Gameplay is short, I beat it in less than a day.  I liked it but like one other person said, you better have something else to play after this
+ You will not be dissapointed by buying this game! If you like RPGs, Action, and/or Adventure games, you'll love this one. There is soooooo much to do! Even after you've beat the game. With the huge maps, tons of free roaming space, and exciting side missions, you can play for hours without even starting the main mission. The sound and graphics are just about the best I've ever seen! The mian story is also awesome. It's easy to follow and tons of fun to play! Buy this!!!!
- Tediously long and weary. Nothing interesting, just a lot of borrowed ideas from RTCW, HL2, etc. I am sick of this
- Beautiful graphics and nice storyline, but the amount of times the game freezes or you receive an error is just awful! Not to mention, the monsters level up with you so you'll never be at an advantage. You could pretty much beat the game at level 5 
- I bought the game couple of weeks ago. I was hesitating on buying it initially, but finally I did because of all the good hype about the game. I wish I didn't buy it.To be fair, I have to admit that the game has astonishing landscape, cities and the level of details in the game. I don't think I have ever seen suhc creativity and perfectness in earlier games. I am sure that are lot of people that will find such features enaough for them to adore the game.For me, landscape is not enough since the largest downside is the story, if there is any story, "from my perspective". I have abandoned playing after closing the 4th or 5th Oblivion gate. I don't see any excitment in playing the game any further. I explored most of the cities though, quite quickly. The conversation looks silly that every time the camre will zoom in to the person you are chating with. It was nice the first couple of times but then ....I am waiting for my sweet gothic3 to go out. Honestly I would prefer playing Gothic1 on playing oblivion. Just to tell you about the action/excitment I am talking about, I would like to say that when I got gothic2 I played for almost 36 hours straight no food no sleep just drink water and play play and lots of play.
+ I'm going to keep this short because the game doesn't deserve a review longer than the actual game play.  great idea, tons of fun, addictive, and SHORT.  my only complaint, just when I was digging the game, I beat it.  alittle disappointing, definitely worth $20, just make sure you have something else to do after you beat it
- I bought this adaptor because my kids and I have both the Nintendo DS and DS Lite. It works great on the original DS, but the thing that's supposed to fit into the DS Lite is too wide. If you're looking for an adaptor for just the regular DS, this one works great. If for the DS Lite, don't waste your money
+ Microsoft has created an extraordinary machine. Crisp graphics and so far the library of games available are impressive. The only problem I have is that Microsoft produced a defective product. For the first few months it played fine with only aa couple of moments where the games would freeze. No biggie. Then it died. No problem, sent it in for repairs under warranty. Free of charge. Cool. Got it back and it played well with me actually beating Ghost Recon with no problems. I stopped playing for a while but when I tried playing again BAM! Ring of Death. Warranty over. $130-140 dollars to fix. Yay. I think I'm going to throw it against the wall and buy a new one. Hopefully Microsoft has found all the solutions to the defects.
- Really? Wow. So, players in real football go through other players torso's? They skate and glide around the field at 40MPH without moving their legs? WR's change direction on one foot, pivot, glide and elude tackles? Uh, ok.Anyone who plays this game on the All-madden level will notice right away that this is the furthest thing from a realistic football game.What are the nerds at EA thinking? Do they ENJOY making a game who's AI constantly cheats? I love how they tout games that "give the user more control" when the user has very LITTLE CONTROL over anything that goes on in the game. I don't control if I catch it or drop it, or intercept it, or if my line blocks, of if my DB's cover their assignment...none of it. The COMPUTER makes my line miss blocks or not block at all...drop easy picks...drop easy catches, etc. And why, oh why, are DT's and LB's faster than my fastest WR? Is THAT realistic? The AI is terrible. It blatantly and UNrealistically cheats.Terrible game. Just stop making these games if this is your final product
- I bought the piece of junk from Amazon and I regret the day I started using Amazon. The machine did not work and the customer service of Amazon was the worst I have ever experienced. I will never ever shop Amazon again.
+ The next-gen console wars are now officially in full-swing with the release of the PS3 and Wii. So, that leaves everyone with the decision of choosing the right system. I'll start with saying that the Wii fits a different demographic than the PS3 and 360...perhaps a gamer looking for something different, or perhaps a system for a family with young ones. Also, if you want to try to get your girlfriend to play games with you, this system would be the one to do it. To me it makes a good second console, but for the hardcore gamer this is not going to satisfy as a core gaming machine.The real battle for the traditional/hardcore gamer market is between the 360 and the PS3. I own a 360, and have followed the PS3 closely until release, and have played it. The two systems are very close in power, regardless of what Sony's marketing hype and brainwashing tactics might lead you to believe. The Cell processor cannot slice bread, and let's just leave it at that. Currently, the better library belongs to the 360. It has more AAA titles than the PS3, and it will remain that way throughout 2007. The Xbox 360 simply has a better lineup. Gears of War is one of the best games you will ever play...it is incredible in every way, and features new game-play mechanics that make it more than just another cookie-cutter shooter like Resistance. I would call Resistance a very good game, but Gears is a truly great game.Lost Planet, exclusive to Xbox, will follow this up in early 2007 with more 3rd person shooting action. If you have not seen this game, prepare to be amazed. RPGs are covered with Oblivion the upcoming galactic epic Mass Effect, and the eerie underwater adventure-RPG BioShock. Alan Wake is another hit in the making, along with Too Human from talented developer Silicon Knights. That is a lot of brand new IPs for the 360! Sony no longer has a hold on Grand Theft Auto, and we will see GTA4 in 2007 debut on the 360 at the same time as PS3. Add to that better versions of the Tom Clancy games, since the primary development platform is the 360 for those franchises. Racing? Got the sequel to the acclaimed Forza Motorsport. Finally, what better way to end 2007 than with Halo 3??? If you simply must have the new Metal Gear and Devil May Cry, the PS3 is for you. I am tired of those games, not to mention Final Fantasy XIXXIXV. The 360 offers what I see as the best gaming experience...refreshing new titles, sequels to legacy Xbox titles, amazing graphical power, and the most comfortable controller on the market. Not only that...it's cheaper to boot
+ I must say.  I am a owner of a xbox and xbox 360.  I will never, and I repeat never, buy another system.  The xbox360 clearly blows all the competition away.  Sony fans do not stand a chance.  With the best graphics and game-play on the planet.  Microsoft is clearly #1.  I have a first generation xbox 360 and have never had a problem to this day. If you want a awesome system, that works with your Media Center, plays music, cds, display's pictures, great game-play both offline and online, free demos, maps, characters, and movies via the awesome xbox live, then my friend, this system is definitely for you.  Thanks Bill Gates. Now, go make a hand held one.. :-)))))) 
- I don't even have to explain the worst bait and switch tatic I have ever seen...  [...]  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE AMAZON BAIT AND SWITCH.. [...]... I will never shop on AMAZON AGAIN
- I'll cut to the chase on this one. If you are a fan of Final Fantasy VII, you will look over the shortcomings of this game and find some enjoyment out of it. It has a good story and characters. Its fun to see some of your favourite characters from VII return. But if your not a FF fan, then you won't have much motivation to play this game, and I'm not sure why you would like it. Its very average to mediocre as a action game. Its not horrible by any means, but its just not very good either. Honestly, this game could have just been so much better, in just about every aspect. Gameplay wise, there is nothing unique or interesting about it, and I was just trying to blow through it too get to the next story part. Its also pretty easy and not very challenging. I can't really complain about the environments your fighting through tho, they are well done and some are very well done in my book.While the story is easily the strongest part of the game, its not without faults either. It's pacing isn't very good, and some of it doesn't make a whole lot of sense either. But it's kept alive by a strong cast of characters, and some amazing FMV's in typical square fashion. But the story could of been much better as well. I'm not complaining, because it is good and gives you a good backstory of Vincent, but it could of been better if it had been longer. It just feels rushed, and suffers because of that. I finished the game at about 11 hours. If it had been longer and closer to 20 hours they really could of done some special things with the story, and developed the villians more. Bottom line, if your a FF fan, you'll probably enjoy it
-   As was said in a earlier review the creators of final fantasy are giving us everything but what we actually asked for.  They gave us Advent Children, cell phone games, and finally Dirge of Cerberus.  This game is an action based game showing you a day in the life of the most under-used and least interesting character in the Final Fantasy Series.  Its the creators way of telling us that they will never re-make Final Fantasy VII but will rather insult us with every marketing ploy know to man
+ I have had this unit for almost 6 months and love it. Halo 2 is awesome as are other shooters. They can keep the new generation of others, xbox had it right on this one and its perfect.
- I can't believe how many people are saying how "realistic" this game is.  That can not be further from the truth.  All the CPU does is lob the ball down field on 3rd and long plays and the receiver catches it 80% of the time regardless of coverage.  What fun is that?  This in itself is highly unrealistic.  Don't even get me started on the other things this game does. NCAA 2006 is nothing but an arcade game, realism is thrown out the window in this one.  EA does not know the meaning of AI.  The only difference between the levels is the amount of cheating the CPU does.Don't waste your money, and don't make EA any more richer, its obvious they just throw these games together.  They just take our money and laugh all the way to the bank. 
- I really tried to like this game, being that EA chickened out and bought their way out of competition.The graphics and sound are great in this game, but its ruined by EA's cheating AI. I have never seen a game cheat this much in my life. No matter what play you call the defence always knows what you are calling, even if you think you have them beat on a play, your receiver will purposely drop a wide open pass or better yet the defender turns on his nitrous oxide that was installed in his uniform and cover half the field in 2 seconds to deflect a pass. If you throw a high pass, not to worry the lineman has installed jet packs which allows them to jump 10 feet in the air and deflect or pick off your pass. If the CPU wants you to lose you will lose no matter what you do. If you QB is going back for a pass and a lineman is 3 feet away from you, even if you press the passing button, your QB will just stand there so he can take a sack. This game is total BS, there is no way to get off passes in heavy pressure becuase the game forces you into a tackle animation. When you are playing defence, you are better off putting down your controller and clipping your nails or flossing your teeth while the CPU pulls of BS miracle plays on every single down. Remember how I said your receivers will purposely drop wide open passes? Not the CPU receivers, the CPU receivers, regardless of their rating can catch passes in double and triple coverage every time. if they don't catch it, the ball just gets tipped over and over again until he can catch it. Think you stopped a 3rd down conversion? Think again, you will get flagged for pass interference or a face mask penatly. And remember about your QB being forced into a tackle animation? Not the CPU, the CPU can get of 60 yard spirals while he's being hit! What about the inconsistency you ask? Well let me explain. How is it that one game you can be totally on, but the next game, you can't even complete ONE pass! I'll tell you why. The CPU wants you to lose, so you will drop every pass, fumble every run and get called for every penalty in the book. I was playing a game, and managed to run back a punt and KR for a TD, before my offense even touched the field. Then all of a sudden the CPU turned on its God Mode and every thing went right for the CPU. BS lobs, BS runs and BS calls. I did not complete ONE SINGLE pass in the entire first half. Its not because the CPU was playing good defence, its because my receivers dropped every ball that was thrown to them, wide open or not. I ended up only completing one pass in the entire game, 1 for 20 I think. At this point, I knew I had no chance of winning, so I just started punting the ball on first down to avoid any more frustration. My so called impact RB only got 2 yards on 20 rushes, and my so called impact CB gave up 3 TD passes to a below average receiver. What is the point of playing if you are not even given a chance to win? Yes you can win games as I have, but it is so inconsistent. If the CPU wants you to lose you will lose, nothing you can do about it.I see why EA bought the license, after putting out crap like this, they were sure to lose a lot of customers to a game that knows how to develop better AI, instead of this cheating crap. I am taking this game to the store for store credit and I am done with EA for good. EA sucks and so does this game
- If you need a remote to turn on the tele and run the 360, this will do.  But it won't operate a DVR, DVD, VCR or cable box.  If you're really keen on it, I'll sell you mine.
+ Not only is "We Love Katamari" way better then the first, but you get to play the prince's cousins. Some of the cousins are faster, some are slower and some seem stronger then others. Also some of the Katamari's have earth elements such as a big snowball Katamari and a fireball one too. The fireball is kind of tricky, you have to keep the fire on it burning, if not the level fails, also watch out for the water, it will put it out, no matter how big it is. Last but not least to finish "We Love Katamari", you need to convert your progress from "Katamari Damacy" to this one. If you did delete the first one from you memory card, then to bad, you'll have to play the first all over again.    
+ This game is mysteriously hilarious and always fun to play. You don't exactly "finish" it, like other video games, but are always trying to beat your fastest time, so it doesn't get old as fast. As a matter of fact, we wore out our last copy and this is our second. I love it and I'm the parent! My kids and I play it together and cheer each other on. The only thing I would change is make the two-player part funner and stop the giant messages that pop up and cover the whole screen occassionally. I would keep them in the corner instead. Overall, highly recommend this game. More than your money's worth
- No way to change the inputs on your TV.The DVD functions and the TV functions are accessed alternatly by pressing a "tv" button but there is no way to tell which the romote is aligned to. Therefore when you press the power button you have no idea which you will be powering on/off, the TV or the XBox. And if things couldn't get any dumber, if you press the eject button while the remote is in TV mode it doesn't work. The eject button is only designed to work with the XBox yet it is disabled when in TV mode? There is also no option to program a receiver.As many others mentioned, this remote looks nice but the people who designed it must have been drunk. Do not buy this remote unless you like wasting your money on garbage
- Try before you buy! This game has a major glitch: its save game files are erased sometimes, so you can start all over again.Beware
- First, let me say that I whole-hearedly agree with the review by Tiberius. Back in the glory days of Counter-Strike (2001-2002), this game was the be-all end-all for 1) Online video games, 2) First-Person Shooters, 3) PC Games, and 4) Any video game basically. It had real-life weapons, the graphics were superb at the time, the maps were extremely well-made, the system requirements are still obscenely low, and damnit it was fun. Then, inevitabely, the hands of time began to take their ruthless, indiscriminate toll. Video cards supported better graphics, new (and yes, better!) games came out (Battlefield 1942, Unreal Tournament 2004), hacking became the unmistakable poison of Counter-Strike, and a lot of the cool, casual gamers grew up or moved on. From 2000 to 2004, Counter-Strike went from an utter joy to a sensation to a fading diamond to a nuisance. By 2004 to present day, it has become a problem. Great games and great game developers are losing tons of money because people are still playing this game after five years on their mom's worn-out 640 Megahertz Pentium III PCs running Windows 98. Counter-Strike is still one of the most popular games of all-time, with a ridiculous number of people playing it on average a day, because people just don't seem to have enough self-control to give up their hopeless addiction.Today, server admins are, for the most part, humorless dictators, and will not stand for anything that deviates from this game's undeniable, monotonous drone. People are still playing the same maps from the 1.0 release, that have completely lost all their zest and initial potential. It always feels as if I've played the same round a thousand times before, and I probably have. Even the custom maps are sickening in their monotony. fy_iceworld is fun for 3 consecutive seconds. Many other popular custom maps in heavy server rotation are the same way, and all look disguisting. I've played on probably over 500 servers, and downloaded probably over the same amount of *quality* custom maps, and not more than 3 have I ever seen a server run in its rotation, or voted on by the players. Furthermore, people are still playing the game using dial-up, and CS veterans are always complaining about camping, even if its a tactic used to complete the objective. As far as the objectives are concerned, Counter-Strike has basically become a deathmatch game. No one will listen to anyone's plan (on the rare occasion there is one), no one tries to rescue the hostages, and everyone always calls someone a "p***y" or "nub" if you use the auto shotgun or AWP. And to top it all off, Valve cancelled the outstanding won.net and replaced it with this Steam garbage, a utility soaking wet with incompetence.L337 Speak has also gained mass popularity to the jaded Counter-Strike culture, and has become its own incessant frustration. But I won't even get into that. If you're new to CS, don't bother, veterans of this game are far from friendly, and you'll probably get called a bunch of names involving lots of zeroes and threes if you're a beginner. For now, if you want to indulge yourself in a great online game, check out World of Warcraft, Battlefield 1942, Sven Co-Op, or even Team Fortress Classic (a dated game with an *awesome* community that has yet to lose its initial charm)
- I'll make this short and sweet for you.  I went to a cyber cafe so I can play this "gem" and see what all the fuss is about on this game.  OVERRATED.  I have no idea how people prais this as "THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD!!"...How silly, This game is just plain average..  If you wanna play a nice Game from Valve..I don't need to tell you but I'll give you a hint....H***f L*fe...This game is just pure garbage and the Online is boring...And I don't need your flaming or bashing just cause One mans opinion differs from yours..The goodVisuals are good I guessBadVery MediocerPlain boring combat...Nothing newOnline isn't that greatExtreamly Overrated...TRUST ME..Gets boring after awhileAnd yes I played this out for more then an 1hour...2 bucks I'll never get back2.1 out of 5 stars....  Extreamly Overrated, Not worth my 2 bucks, and that's all I got to say....Peac
- why is it that 3rd party memory cards can store at least double the information that these can? These memory cards are way over priced. I love PS2. It's one of the best systems I have ever played and owned, but this memory card stuff is a scam. I already own 2 cards and I need more.
- Before I was even done with Final Fantasy VII, I ordered this game. I loved that game, and thought 'Say, if Final Fantasy VII is this good, then VIII must be even better!', boy was I wrong! I'm not bashing Final Fantasy VIII, I kind of liked the game, but there are big problems with it. First of all, the draw system is kind of hard, but I liked it, it was a change of pace, but the way you have to equip summon GFs (Guardian Force) was hard and boring. The music in the game reminds me of the music in the movie 'AKIRA', which is a bad thing, The characters in battle remind me of crash dummies, and the way that you get new weapons is by making them at junk shops! Not only that, but the characters are not very likeable.Main characters:Squall- A member of SeeD, he is a jerk to everybody.Zell-A member of SeeD, he is a surfer dude and a dunce.Quistis-A teacher and a member of SeeD, she seems to like Squall...for one reason or another...Seifer- Squall's rival, he is even worse then Squall.Rinoa- A member of 'The owls',Square soft ran out of ideas, she is just like Aeris.Selphie- A member of SeeD, she is a weird character and I was sad to see her in Kingdom hearts.Laguna- A Galbadian soldier. He is the best charecter in the game.Irvine-A member of SeeD, he is a lady's man and is recycled later in Final Fantasy IX as a better charecter known as Zidane.This game is the second worst Final Fantasy game ever made. The story is great, but playing it is so bad that its almost unbelivable. If Square soft remade this game for the PS2 or PSP, I would buy it, but only if they removed the draw system
+ This is another praise for the game, rolled into the other praises. By now, you've read the synopsis by others: your character the Prince (or one of his cousins) rolls an orb (I.e. Katamari), which collects every object in the level. This game works on many levels, it is first and foremost absurd and bewildering. The introductory animations and cut scenes are off-the-wall yet amusing. The incessant rolling is cathartic and addictive, the bonuses involve finding hidden presents and cousins in the level. There are many variations on the rolling theme in the game (roll a sumo wrestler into food, roll a snowball onto a snowman, roll fireflies into a kid's reading light, time trials, etc), but the most satisfying is the original premise of rolling everything and anything into as large a ball as possible. Once you start to consume people, trucks, skyscrapers, ships, clouds, etc, then you feel very powerful.Music is very catchy, something vacant from many video games.My only criticism: the cooperative two player mode can venture into frustration quite easily. My wife and I played, who are both good at the game, but you often find yourself awkwardly and slowing moving where you want. And that's part of the problem, where you want to roll may not be where the other person wants to roll...so communicate well
- I bought the piece of junk from Amazon and I regret the day I started using Amazon. The machine did not work and the customer service of Amazon was the worst I have ever experienced. I will never ever shop Amazon again.
+ This game is a lot of fun.  The level of control is actually less challenging in this one then the original and the music isn't as good in this newest version, but this game is certainly still a strong choice for those rainy days
- If you are looking for an XBOX vertsion of another chapter in MechWarrior series, this ISN'T it. This is an extemely dumbed-down version of MW. Even if you (Mechwarrior fans) forget about having no customization, remember this: You can only fire one weapon at at time. You have to cycle between lazers, cannons and rockets. I was bored after about 5 minutes.Again, people who never played MW series may like this game better
- As the opening cutscene introduces you to Blinx the cat, the supporting cast and the particulars of his upcoming adventures, I found myself trying to wrap my brain around the basic premise of the story. The idea is that a secret, off-world clan of humanoid cat creatures, armed with souped up vacuum cleaners, are responsible for the development and dispersal of time itself to every known plane of existence on the map. It seems that time, when compressed tightly enough to be transported by said cats, takes the form of one of five different brightly-colored shapes. If these crystals are left out on the open for too long without being properly introduced to the flow of things, they turn into monsters. I could go on, because the game certainly doesn't stop there, but I think you get the point. I like to think that there's a fairly thick line drawn between cartoony fantasy and super-detailed realism. Generally, a lot of the physics and environmental details are taken for granted in a realistic game, because they're almost exclusively set in a photorealistic, lifelike location. Cartoons, on the other hand, generally don't worry themselves with the particulars and are primarily concerned with delivering a good time. How much fun would the Wile E. Coyote cartoons be if every time the lead character suffered a grisly fate, it strictly obeyed the laws of gravity and aerodynamics? Blinx tries to straddle that thick line by delivering a story that's overly detail-centric in an environment that's right out of a kid's show. The result is a tale that comes off as way, WAY out of left field and almost completely abstract. It focuses on things that would be better left to the viewer's imagination and ignores the importance of a good underlying story along the way.Beneath the needless discussions of why there are monsters in the world, how time compression works and how cats are actually responsible for all that we hold dear, the actual plot is almost laughably straightforward and generic. There's a princess, evil pigs have kidnapped her, and it's up to you and you only to rescue her and save her world. That's it, no side-stories, no reasoning, no subplots - just a straightforward rush from Point A to Point B. And here I thought the phrase "save the princess" was universally recognized as an ages-old cliche.Now, I don't want it to sound like I'm railing on this game just because it's got a few more nitpicky details than its peers and it reuses an old phrase from way back in the platformer handbook as its sole driving factor. It's also completely lacking in character development, general storytelling and ongoing inspiration. None of the characters in Blinx really establish themselves as individuals, including the lead character himself. You don't hate the pig on the spaceship because he's trying to destroy the world, you hate him because every time he shows up he tries to steal your money. I honestly forgot there was a princess at the end of the game after level three, because she's never mentioned between the game's start and its finish. I mean, the very first Super Mario Brothers at least reminded you that the princess was in another castle at the end of every boss fight. I don't honestly think the game was really designed to be enjoyable so much as it was geared to be overly challenging. The first level and a half are set up in the standard "get to know you" format, with the simplest of enemies, the most routine of stage layouts and plenty of opportunities to mess around with your tools. Shortly thereafter, you're thrown to the wolves. For the most part, the level designs are very short, with more of an emphasis on cheap hits than on complexity and true challenge. I noticed a lot of overlap in the stage layouts, whether it's retracing your steps time and time again or walking along a catwalk (har har) above the beginning of the stage and invariably plummeting back to the start point. You'll almost always know what needs to be done, but actually accomplishing that act is the real trick. I just can't overemphasize how unbearably cheap most of this game really is. If there's a bottomless pit nearby, (and chances are very good that there is) Blinx will find a way to force himself into it, regardless of what you're hitting on the control pad. If there's an enemy two feet in front of you and you hit the attack button, he'll aim at a random switch on the other side of the room, rather than the imminent threat. That's not to say that the entirety of The Time Sweeper is totally without merit, because it does bring a few fresh ideas to the table, but for the most part those insights are hampered by their surroundings. The ability to control time, for instance, was at the time a really fresh, interesting new play mechanic and still stands out today, despite the limited field of imitators that have since emerged. You can rewind a few seconds to catch an enemy unaware or rebuild a crumbling bridge, pause the action and take advantage of the frozen time, knock the level into slow motion, etc. All the while, Blinx is moving around in real time. It's a great idea, but the implementation is painfully short and underutilized. Why can't I use two controls at the same time? Why don't more aspects of the stage encourage the player to experiment with and solve problems with these powers? Why doesn't the ridiculous ten minute stage time limit pause, speed up or rewind when I use my time powers? Why is their duration so brief, and why can't I hold more than a dozen uses at a time? I mean, this could've really been a fantastic experience if the time control aspect had been beefed up a little further and treated as more than just an auxiliary function of an otherwise run-of-the-mill platformer.The controls, too, are an undeveloped, undertested nightmare. Blinx himself is often sluggish to respond, especially when implementing his time controls. He has difficulty making a precise turn, whether on midair or on solid ground. He stops to briefly celebrate when gaining an item, which leaves him open to constant enemy attacks. He routinely moves in the direction of certain death, as though pulled by a magnetic field, whether you've instructed him to do so or not. He'll occasionally refuse to perform a double jump, particularly when attempting a difficult, precise leap across a gaping chasm. I think it's these controls that most make Blinx so mind-squashingly aggravating. At a glance, you'd imagine they'd be fairly difficult to screw up. You've got a jump button, a suction / fire button, a time control button and an analog stick to control movement. Plus, there had already been a long, established line of three-dimensional platformers on the market in the years before the title's release, paving the way to an ideal control experience. Super Mario 64 had its issues, sure, but nothing like this, and it was the trailblazer for the entire genre's jump to the world of 3D. It's like they had a map leading them right to the treasure and decided to forge their own path anyway.I can't even say I'm impressed by the graphics showcased throughout The Time Sweeper, either. With the exception of the lead character himsef, these are some incredibly cheesy, preschoolish character designs - they feel unfinished and hurried, less purposeful than you'd imagine (especially in contrast with Blinx himself). Particularly insulting is the large population of simple blobs that roam around the levels, trying in vain to bump into you and cause a fatal injury. Here's a finely detailed main character, with such close attention paid to his wardrobe that even the gloss of his shoes was obviously debated time and time again, and he's pitted against a set of monsters that could've sprung to life directly out of the pages of a four-year-old's sketchbook. Despite featuring a spoken dialog track, there's no English voice acting. I couldn't pinpoint the language, but my wife seems to think it's either French or some close variation of it. It certainly didn't sound Japanese. While this does add a touch of personality to the title, and it's not every day that you get a chance to hear a cat shouting something in the language of love, it all seemed really odd and out of place coming out of my television. Everyone's vocal personalities are so black-and-white, too, that I feel like a great chance to establish some much-needed individuality amongst the cast was lost once again here. The bad guys all have the same deep, gravelly, transparently evil tone, while the good guys are all bright, cheery, squeaky and high-pitched like the monkeys in Super Monkey Ball. It's like a parody of the games that had come before, but I won't give the developers enough credit to assume that they were doing it on purpose.Overall, Blinx is really just a few promising concepts thrown together in one package, strapped to the shell of a far-below-average third person platformer and unleashed upon an unsuspecting public. At the time of its release, it was still in need of a lot of polishing, some serious scrutiny behind closed doors and a re-evaluation of just how far some of these concepts and half-hearted character designs could be conceivably stretched without losing any quality. On top of that, I really don't know which audience they were targeting with it. The game is ridiculously difficult, which betrays the childlike demeanor that surrounds it and leads me to believe it was meant for the serious gamers out there, but so bright, kid-friendly and annoyingly cutesy that I can't imagine anyone in that demographic rushing out to the stores on release day. The number of spontaneous controller hurls shot through the roof during my time with Blinx, reaching near-Marvel vs. Capcom 2 levels with its unashamed, excruciatingly cheap hits, especially in later levels. I have no idea how I acquired the willpower to finish level eight.The game is adequately lengthy, and offers some replay value, with hidden cat medals in each stage eventually unlocking production sketches, promotional materials and the like. Once you start hunting for floating cat heads in those super-tough later levels, though, you'll remember why you were so happy to be finished with them in the first place. Unless you feel like pulling your hair out in clumps (I shaved my head after the experience as a part of the cleansing process) and enjoy self-mutilation, I'd recommend you stay far away
+ This headset is probably the best xbox live recommended headset to date. Everything on the earpiece is adjustable to fit every size of ear. The big xbox live headsets are uncomfortable and begin to hurt after about a half hours use. Wearing the Halo 2 headset I actually forgot that I was even wearing it because it is so light. They have just released a new version of this headset that also comes the communicator with no difference in price. I greatly recommend this headset to anyone that plays xbox live on a regular basis
+ This headset is way better than the X Box one, considering the X Box one broke in a hurry. The sound quality is awesome and you don't get any annoying breathing in the mic. Pick this one up
- I hate this game its the worst game I've ever played
+ While I did not have to spend retail on this headset(I got it along with an Xbox and several other things on Ebay), I did have to buy the communicator(which can be found on gamestop.com) and it was still worth the money.  It blocks out background noises so that the people you are talking to wont hear other people in the household talking or guests that you have with you talking to you.  While it is not worth $50, if you can get it as part of a deal with something else, by all means do it.Note: I said this before in my review but the Communicator can be found on gamestop.com or on Amazon if you type: Xbox Live Communicato
- I was so excited to see this game come out- I loved the Godfather, and From Russia with Love, and the hype surrounding this game was incredible.  The actual game, however, was incredibly disappointing.  The driving controls, especially compared to the driving controls in The Godfather, are AWFUL.  I was having so much trouble driving I kept looking through the handbook to see if I was doing something wrong, but from what I saw I was using the controller the way I was supposed to.  Most of the missions involve driving, under a specific time limit, and with these awful controls, I gave up early- way too frustrating.  The musical play list that you get to control was fun, but I would have liked more free-roaming like in the Godfather.  I was also looking forward to hearing everyone's voices that were in the opening credits- Dale Earnhardt Jr???  But since I have almost totally given up on it now, I guess I won't get to hear their voice acting talent.  Does anyone know if they plan to re-release this on the xbox 360?  Maybe some of the control issues could be worked out before then.  This game had so much potential that right now it is not living up to
+ I love this game, and I've been playing it every since it came out. Its not one of those boring after a whilePros: -Good graphics-Good game-play-Lots of mechs-Live support-Content download (A LOT!) -up to 8 people on xbox live-lots of missionsCons: -Can get a bit repetetiv
- Every year there has to be a game adapted from a classic movie or based on a classic movie (From Russia With Love, which is actually not a bad game.). Recentlty just landing my hands on a copy of this, I simply couldn't resist picking up SCARFACE: THE WORLD IS YOURS. I loved the movie SCAR FACE, and I was gonna love this.But It turns out I didn't.The controls are really a joke, instead of your normal FPS/3PS/RPG etcetera, there are really bland controls you can't even tell what to do. The dialouge is corny, and everything else is a joke.For die-hard fans only, I guess
- This game has a good concept, nice graphics, and some definitely funny moments, but the game-play is a total bore. There are two main game-play styles: "investigation" and "trial". Investigation is the worst; it involves nothing more than checking everything in a room, talking to everyone, and a ton of pointless reading, much like an old point-and-click adventure on PC. The court sections are a little better, but not much. Once again, it's very linear; you don't have to use your brain much, just try all the options. And once again, there is a huge amount of reading. There is way too much dialogue packed into the game, and not near enough actual game-play. And most of the talking is aimless, too; very little of it actually advances the plot.Overall, this game just tried way too hard to have good plot and characters, and left the player with little more to do than click on objects and scroll through text
+ MechAssault is a great game for anyone who wants to be able to  destroy everything in his path, and school armys with one huge battle machine. Destroying other Mechs and tanks as well. But when you finish the main game and have all of the mechs, then you would throw it aside not play it again? No. Not if you have Xbox Live. In Live you can play Capture The Flag, download new Mechs, and play with hundreds of players just like you, and you will always come back for more. If you don't have Xbox Live or a system link, that your wasting your money.    
- My nephew really needed a new controller.  So I ordered this along with a game for his birthday.  The game was received fine, but he never received the controller.  I finally got notification of shipping delay several weeks later.  Yet the controller still listed as ships within 24 hours on Amazon.  The delays kept coming and eventually it just turned into a cancelled order by Amazon.  So the 1 star is for the service, the delay, and the lack of full explanation.  Who knows, the controller could have been wonderful??
- The Playstation controller is nice. However the Nintendo 64 user would remember that the N64 controller was just a snazzy, maybe even more so. The XBOX controller is like a brick when compared to both. The PS2 delivered on a vibrating Dual Shock controller as standard with the unit. This controller feels great with the thumb pads / thumb sticks allowing for all sorts of movement. Suddenly in 2005, four years after the PS2 was released, games like Metal Gear Solid III: Snake Eater and God of War improve on this thumb pad function with the new mini-games feature. The controller has been given new life because of this.The big negative is the problem that Sony PS2 controllers are extremely poor quality. This controller, for all its design, will give you a dual shock. First of all you will be shocked at how suddenly they break. Drop it on the floor and you will easily damage the L1, L2 or R1, R2 wing buttons. Even if you don't drop it the wing buttons will usually break in less than a year if you enjoy gaming. The next shock is going through so many of these controllers because of this design flaw. Adding up the cost of each controller I could easily have bought myself another PS2 and then some more. The cord also has an uncanny ability to just wrap around itself and kink. I have never seen one that managed to remain straight. Also when a button breaks it tends to release little pieces into the controller so even if you don't need that button for the game the controller feels like it has sand rolling around inside of it.For all its handheld conditioning the controller is far from robust. I have used a very similar Logitech Cordless Rumblepad 2 for the PC that is the same design as the PS2 controller and that is a proper robust model. Just comparing the two side by side makes the PS2 controller look like it was developed in the USSR in the early 80s or something. The fact that Sony have done absolutely nothing to improve on the quality of their own generic PS2 controller is probably the reason why they have made so much money out of the PS2 unit. It is a way too expensive even if the controller was more robust. I hope Sony get it right with the PS3 next time. Make these controllers more robust please. The PS2 controller was always far from a quality device since its inception and is the only item that let the PS2 down badly
+ very scary at first, I was literely shaking while playing this game, I couldn't stop playing it!!
+ I remember when "Doom 3" first came out there was a lot of hype on the Internet. People were claiming it would blow away the release of "Half-Life 2" with id's new engine, etc. etc. etc.Unfortunately, "Doom 3" is a rather standard shoot-'em-up. It's fun for a little while, but it lacks the originality and inventiveness of games like "Half-Life 2" (which was amazing). "Half-Life" kept me engaged because the terrain changes; the characters change; and so on. In "Doom 3" it's basically just a lot of walking around through dimly-lit corridors. Monsters jump out and you kill them. It's fun for a while but then it becomes tiring - much like a haunted house ride would become tiring after five hours straight.Furthermore the graphics engine really isn't what everyone made it out to be. I just bought a new PC this year and it runs this game very well on maximum settings - the game-play isn't choppy or anything. But even at full potential with graphics I think they're just "OK." The shadowing is brilliant but the textures are average and some of the characters in the cut-scenes are downright laughable - one of the Commanders early on looks like a character from "AvP 2," and that game came out in 2001!The in-game play is much better - characters look more realistic - but I have to wonder what the rush was with the cut-scenes. One would think they'd spend more attention to detail on these.Overall I have to admit that while I found this fun at times it gets tedious after a while. I mean, the gimmick with the flashlight is annoying (as someone else pointed out) - I think in the beginning it's okay but they should have planted an upgrade early on in the game, such as a helmet with a flashlight attached to the top; or nightvision goggles that last for a minute or two before they have to be recharged; because dropping your flashlight and picking up a weapon while you're being shot at by enemies is annoying.And as another reviewer pointed out, the PDA gimmick gets old fast.Overall this has moments of absolute brilliance but I felt like so much more could have been done with it. They should have abandoned the concept of being "alone in the dark" throughout the entire game and done a bit more with it - I would have loved to have explored the Martian planet more or even levels that don't look exactly the same. Because the repetitive nature of the game is ultimately what sinks it.It's good, but I think "Half-Life 2" was far better and the graphics engine on HL was stunning, even two years later
- You get a few outfits and some new furniture but not a lot.  With all of the free stuff out there to download for The Sims, the Stuff Pack is not very worth it.  Maxi is just milking the franchise for every penny
+ A brilliant remake of the original classic! Although I am an avid fan of the first DOOM...I strongly urge you to NOT juxtapose the two. If you sit back and pick apart the differences between them, you'll never enjoy DOOM 3. Why is this game well worth the buy? Many reasons. Superb graphics is the first that you'll notice. The environment is rich and detailed. Don't worry about whether or not your computer can handle it. You can easily build one that is easily capable at running the game with full settings for less than $900...and if you're comp is so old that you can't run it like this...you may have been due for an upgrade anyways. The weapons are great and very realistic. Like the real world, your arsenal must be reloaded after so many rounds are fired. A handy pair of digits will help you monitor your clip and total ammo for any weapon though. So, plan ahead and keep your guns fully loaded. As for the endless series of hallways that some people are complaining about...it makes absolutely no sense to have a stadium set up on a Mars Research Base. The game offers plenty of larger rooms to adequately utilize heavier weapons such as the rocket launcher without blowing your own face off.The ambient sounds of the game are more than enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. Dead bodies will randomly levitate and fly across the room, grates will be knocked around be unseen forces and Betruger's haunting laugh will often accompany many of these ghostly actions and more.The enemies are fierce, the enemies are bad (as in fearful), any one of them can go from easy to kill to downright lethal. You may not get very many good looks at them, but you really shouldn't be trying to admire the pixels of something that's trying to kill you. Take a screenshot and look at that later if you want to take in what the monsters look like. Experiment with your arsenal...learn the best weapon for the job and conserving ammo won't be a problem at all. The big issue that most people seem to have is that of lighting. Yes, in the 22nd century you'd expect Marines to have lights mounted on their weapons. ID Software isn't stupid...a flashlight on all of your guns would have made the game a lot easier and a lot less fun. By switching from your light to your gun...the game forces you to choose between being able to see the enemy and being able to attack the enemy. Remember, this game is of the "Horror" genre. And horror thrives on you asking questions like "Where is it? What is it? Where is it gonna pop out at next?" Go rent a horror movie and you'll see what I mean. It's dark! DOOM 3 is meant to be like this. Buy the game...or borrow it from a buddy. Turns the lights off and turn the volume up. If you like horror...it will pull you right in. 
- I noticed there were not many new items in this game, I found this the advertising for this game to be deceiving.  This expansion ws not worth the money
+ I've been through Doom3 now three times.  The first time I didn't even cheat.I won't go into how great a game it is but will stick to the few short comings.One, the game started off perfect.  A little bit of realism goes a long way but later on degraded into a world of comic bookish nightmareism...skeletons with missile launchers on their shoulders come on!  The bugger man with a rocket launcher in pace of a right hand..AAAH!It isn't hard to figure out why ID did it, they were trying to spice it up a bit to keep it interesting...I understand, I just don't agree.Two, no mass attacks by monsters to use up all your hard won ammunition.  Instead you transport our marine to h-ll to once more search for and find the same things all over again--all these games do that!A monster with a nazi helmet and whip--more comic book filler.Three, a game that has to cheat in every other room searched gets a little irritating.  You know the monster is on the other side of that darkened doorway.  You throw a dozen gernades in there, the monster isn't hurt.  You take that step forward, the monster jumps out  and you blast it.  And then--of course--the monster which appeared out of nowhere behind you, attacks.  The answer of course is walk backward, trip the 'If Then' statment in the program, shoot the monster behind and turn around and shoot the one in front--on your second attempt to get through the door.I do get tired of computer gamecheating because I makes me have to cheat to beat the game.I don't mind the dark areas, the whole base just went to h-ll, I would expect the lights not to always work.Four,  I've heard those h-ll Knights have to be destroyed with that big green glowing plasma gun/cannon.  Well, I did it with thirty eight hand grenades!  The game would have been--I think--better if two or three had been turn loose to roam the hallways looking for humans to munch on randomly.Five, basically, never enough fighting room.  Understandable for a station on another world with pressurized atmosphere.  Rooms would all be small.  Exploding barrels in pressurized enviroment, what a hoot!Yuck, yes I said Yuck instead of the number,  belted ammunition for machineguns usually came in 100 round belts--not sixty.  Mini guns used chained belts--I know, I use to repair them.  The plasma gun's munitions travel far too slow.  The shotgun needs a longer barrel so it still has a choke to keep the pellets from spread out too wide and becoming useless after ten feet.  Handgrenades can't be thrown properly.  Light machinegun's firing rate is half what it should be...and for goodiness sake, get some duck tape for that flashlight and tape to you weapon.The list could go on for these 'little' things...but the game is easily worth the money.  Remember, these are mostly suggestions for ID future program
- Downloading objects from fan sites can be hit or miss -- I have had many collections I've downloaded work incorrectly or not work at all in the next expansion pack, and items I really liked were suddenly unavailable.  So, I was looking forward to a "Stuff" pack from Maxis.Bah.  Yes, there are several very nice items, but really, this is an underwhelming collection on the whole.  Items are very limited and the collections are small.  The pictures you see on the cover are a good portion of what is contained.  Like so many here remarked, the money spent is not equal to the value received.  Another reviewer pointed out what the title "Glamour Life" implies -- jewelry, house items, luxurious textures for floors and walls, and clothing for all ages, and most of all, excess and abundance.  There's no abundance here.  I've found items I like, but I am not impressed with the collection.Maxis knows that its target audience is always hungry for new items, and I think it is taking advantage of the fact, fooling us into thinking we are getting much more than we actually recieve for our money.  I feel a little cheated.  If you must have this, wait until the price drops, or -- better yet -- find a good, reputable fan site  (there are some very good ones out there that have safe downloads) and download for a small fee or for free
+ Let me start off by saying ditto to previous comments about CompDude being off track.  The keys are in there.  I found all four of these games to be great. I haven't gotten into the LOTR one yet because it's graphics-intensive, and I have a laptop.  The other three games are cool too. For the price, it's a great deal (compare to buying the titles individually)
- This pack offered very little of anything. The decor (very little of it) is uninspired. I was hoping to get some good artwork at least.  I know a lot of people don't like to download from fan sites but don't waste your money on this junk.  Believe me fansites have much better and more creative stuff for your sims and most of it is free, and none of it cost  as much as this glamour life stuff pack did.  This is the first and last stuff pack that I will ever buy
+ I was looking for the Black and White Deluxe Version (with expansion pack) and came across this. I was a little hesitant in purchasing it because one of the reviews (by Computer Dude) said none of the games have activation numbers. Let me start by saying that this is not true. This is a little four page installation manual that tells how to install all four games (really five including the Black and White expansion pack) and on the back were all five activation numbers. I installed Black and White without any problems and was up half the night playing it. The only difference between these games and the originals is that all the documentation (manuals etc.) except for the four page installation guide, are on the game CDs. So if you are looking for a couple of these games this is a great deal and the information by computer dude claiming that their are no activation numbers was inaccurate
+ I can only assume that the handful of people rating this game with one star out of five are GTA fanboys or total curmudgeons. Forget comparisons with GTA. Yes, some of the open-world game-play elements are familiar. But this is basically a Tony Montana Simulator, and THAT'S the (very considerable) USP of the game. It's all about "What Would Tony Do?" The conversations are hilarious, the gunplay is great, the vehicle physics are solid, the drug wars game adds an extra layer of strategy and some interesting choices. Sure, there are some periods where game events hit a bit of a lull, but most other games (GTA in particular) are guilty of this. And at its best, this game is an absolute blast. Aside from the decent core mechanics, the game will MAKE YOU LAUGH constantly, which is no small consideration; it's consistently entertaining even when you're NOT busy with a mission, and you can't ask for much more than that
- 1 star for looking at the game cover in the store, 2 stars for the visual and audio and playinggggg.-Walk, pick up specified items, push things, use a few gadgets.-Those save points that are maddening rather than save as you go.-Things to do over for the another character.-Same collection of villans over and over.-The cut scenes are sketched for you and the narration is on and on.-(why do the houses look so similar.)-Stuff in the houses that you can not touch. boring.-Find Things you need but can not use yet and have to go back for it.-Not so puzzle solve as much as fetch this and that.-No free range chicken, doors are often locked.-Had to catch same snakes more than 3 times (weeee)-Atleast if you fail a task you get to try again. -REMEMBER nothing goes well, from the get go.-I found no cheats online for this game as of yet... -Dont play the piano, you hit buttons when they float by on screen.-The kids are cute and each special gadget and moves such as they are.I have Never read these books but there is a Warning at the start of the game that this is depressing and states nothing comes out right for these kids.If you want to try this game rent it.If you want to buy this game for someone......make sure you don't mind making yourself depressed for spending the cash and them for playing it.. Do you play the game or does it play you? :-
- I bought this game 5 days ago and when I finally got it it was missing a pice of plastic in the middle so that I could not play the game and the case was also damage
- When I first played this game, I got bored in 10 minutes.All you do is shoot and kill people for nothing, have the police chase you and you shoot them, Bring girls into your car and do it with them. I don't recommend this game at all its overrated
- OK, so where the heck is Vince Young, Matt Leinart, and Reggie Bush in this version?  You see Reggie Bush on the cover, so you think you're going to get the opportunity to play with the Heisman Trophy winner, pair him up with Lendale White and Matt Leinart, and take on the Longhorns to try and replay the Rose Bowl.  But none of these players are to be found.  In fact, Ohio State is listed as the #1 team.Am I behind the times?  Or is this how EA Sports does their football games?  Do I need to buy NCAA 06 in order to use these players in their prime?  I was hoping to be able to play them with updated "abilities" that would reflect all of their outstanding years in 2005.Any ideas out there?  Is this a code or a "cheat" I need to unlock?HELP!!
+ This game is truly worth the wait.  It really makes you feel like you are creating a drug empire and it is incredibly addicting.  The game-play is awesome the shooting mechanics work great much better than any of the GTA games. This is one of the funnest games to shoot people in and the chainsaw is really awesome.  This probally the funnest open world game I have ever played to drive in.  The cars handle great and are a blast to drive.  The graphics look great and the particle effects are truly awesome.  This is a must get game
+ I picked this up along with Zelda when buying the Wii.  This game is not for those who like realistic driving games, the physics are nothing short of just silly/insane. ...but it is SO FUN!  I love how you get stars for "nice crashes" and running other trucks off the road.  The action is fast and the driving is very intuitive.  (provided you use the tutorials - they teach you all the stunts).   It's not too hard, anyone can play, and it's just fun.  I love flying through the air and morphing the terrain of the track around me.  Highly Recommended, don't overlook this game! 
+ this game is better than madden by a nose, but could be better. game-play is better than madden I think
- I was reading that 8000-word review by Dave Jeanclerc, and I strongly disagree with some of his points.  (P.S. My review has nothing to do with the XBox 360 version, which, apparently, is awesome.)I HAVE PLAYING THE EA FOOTBALL GAMES SINCE THE MID-90'S, and I'm sick of paying $50 for the same game every year.  EA Games owns the rights to the college and NFL teams, so you won't see any football games by any other game companies, most noteably, SEGA, who revolutionized football simulation games in the late 80's.NCAA Football 07 is basically the same as NCAA Football 2002, and 2003, and 2004, and 05 and 06.  Each year, EA adds a little tweak to the mix, but overall, it's the same look, the same feel, the same moves, the same everything.  This year, they've changed the way you kick the ball, and added more defensive audibles--that's it.  There are a few other minor adjustments, but none are worth noting IMO.  In fact, the audibles they added are the EXACT SAME audibles you used to have on Sega's ESPN Football 2005--you can call audibles for individual defensive players.  Thieves.  Everything else is THE EXACT SAME AS 05 and 06.  The most disappointing thing, graphically speaking, is the crowd...it still looks like flat rows of objects moving in unison, just like it did on games made 10 years ago.OH--one other big change...the "improved" momentum meter.  If you thought it was ridiculous last year, wait til you play NCAA 07.  The "momentum meter" has such a strong influence on the game, that if you make ONE OFFENSIVE MISTAKE in the beginning of the game, you're doomed...that's it.  You can't win.  For example--I played FSU vs. UM twice.  The first time, I made no 1st half errors, and pounded the Hurricanes 31-10.  I played with the same exact settings in the same stadium again, and purposely fumbled the opening kickoff, giving the Hurricanes the ball at my 35 yd. line, and I lost the game 45-24.  That fumble was my ONLY MISTAKE of the game.NESSLER, HERBSTRIET AND CORSO ARE STILL MAKING THE SAME EXACT IN-GAME COMMENTS THEY WERE SAYING IN 05 AND 06...GIMME A BREAK!!!!  Also, the AI is still atrocious.  Defensively, the computer controlled team is hapless.  They blitz on every down.  In fact, I've lined up numerous times for a 3rd and long with 4 or 5 receivers, and the defence continually loads 8 men in the box...they don't even put enough DB's out there to stop me.  It's basically a game of long bombs.  If you choose a team with good receivers, you can easily throw for 400+ yards a game by continually going deep.  THE SAFETIES ALWAYS BLITZ!!!  The safeties only drop back into coverage if you have 3rd and 20+, or 4th and 15+.  So how does the computer couteract your deep balls?  Easy--when the momentum meter swings against your favor, your receivers drop EVERY BALL YOU THROW AT THEM, (even if you hit them in the chest with the ball) and when you finally decide to run the ball, your RUNNING BACK FUMBLES THE BALL IMMEDIATELY.  I played a game between USC and Cal, and I kept switching to play with the team that DIDN'T have the momentum, and I ended up turning the ball over on every possession.You may be reading this and saying, "Hey--this guy has played this game a lot to figure all of this out."  No, not really--it's exactly how I've played the 05 and 06 game, and the same "glitches" I've encountered in them, too.  EA has really dropped the ball again.  You are paying $50 to get updated rosters, and, in typical EA fashion, you don't even have names for any of the players--just different skill levels.EA games suck.  Their soccer games are horrible, their basketball games are too slow and awkward, and they don't update their football games.  I GUARANTEE YOU THAT MADDEN 07 WILL BE THE SAME AS MADDEN 06...JUST WATCH.And by the way--EA has gone all-out on the XBox 360 editions of NCAA 07 ans Madden 07...I'm sure those versions will be stunning.  The rest of us are paying the same price for last year's game
+ I've been playing NCAA 2007 for a few weeks now, and here are my thoughts:1) The game simply does as good a job at capturing the feeling of it's sport as any other game.  Anyone who has been to a big-time SEC game understands that the stadium does shake.2) I did not play the "career" mode, I simply prefer control over the whole program.3) Gameplay is very strong, anyone who has played NCAA or Madden in the past will notice the tightening up of the controls.4) I personally do not like the first person camera on special teams plays, it makes it frustratingly difficult to return kicks.5) Likewise I could do without the auto slo-motion on "key" plays.  It absolutely destroys the flow of the play to highlight a catch or hit during the play.  EA, that's what replay is for.6) The system is annoyingly apt to hit me with unsportsmanlike conduct penalties, not just on TD's but simple catches or defensive plays.7)You now have more control over recruiting with in-season recruiting, including mulitple pitches and on-campus visits.8)After all these versions can EA come up with a new set of unlockables.  Changing the logo, or the sponsor(!) does not a new unlockable make
+ No other game looks or plays like this; The missions and locations are varied and colorful; The villians range from a fat guy with dynamite strapped to his person to corrupt law officials; And, as usual, Rockstar keeps the game play challenging but not overly frustrating; Lots of unlockables offer high replay. This is one of the most unique and best looking games on any system, period. I still throw this one in every 6 months for another go thru. The story is straightforward and engaging; Lots of really interesting concepts(machinegun in the coffin, crazy midgets, that whole 'dead-eye' thing...)and it controls very well. Another great game from an outstanding company. Hopefully a sequel is in the works.   
+ this game is good cheap now buy if you didnt before and if you cant afford gun for 49.99 buy this game cause they copied it
- Typical Xbox game using checkpoints instead of creativity to make it challenging. Nothing more mind numbing than doing the same thing over and over again because you keep getting killed right before the next checkpoint. Granted, you can get hours and hours of playing time from it, but only about 25% is something that you haven't already done 10 times before. I highly recommend this game to people who are of the intellect that enjoy working on production lines where they do same thing repeatedly. If your brain actually requires some kind of stimulation, find a more creative game. In addition, some actions tend to be a bit uncooperative at times, such as when attempting to knock someone out but instead you just stand there waiting to get shot. Apparently if you aren't facing in just the perfect position when attempting smash his brains out, you stand there like a manakin hoping the guy two inches in front of you doesn't notice. Another option is to try and shoot him, but unless you get a head shot, expect to fire of gobs of rounds to take him out since you seem to be armed with what can only be a .22 short pistol
- nothing more really needs to be said.I'm running a 3GHz P4;256Mb ATI Radeon 9000 series PCI express video card and 2Gb of RAM and the game still hangs,lags and locks up on my computer. I tried uninstallingandreinstalling-same effect.DO NOT BUY THIS GAM
+ mi a western fanatic I just love the wild west. I try to get my eyes or hands on anything western, wild west tech, desperados, wild wild west, gbatu, so far this game is AWESOME I cant wait for the new western game GUN coming out in nov. one thing this game needs though is... the good the bad and the ugly theme :)that would make this game perfect but untill they dicide to add it mi loopin the song on my cd player with the tv volume down almost all the way just enough to here what there saying
-   The overall impression is that of a game made on the rush.Assuming the "good" alignment, you win simply by building expensive  buildings at the edge of your influence zone and burning the enemy's platoons sent by a very unintelligent AI. Since winning requires no strategy, the game is challenging; you can do basically the same on all levels.    The races against which one fights are pretty much the same except for their "skins" and the building's aspect. Defeating them all takes you at most 8 hours of game-play.   Unlike the previous version of B&W, there are no custom campaigns nor multi-player features. Cinematics and creature apart, it looks like a very primitive first version of "Age of Empires".

+ Splinter Cell is the first in a series of three amazing games (to date). It is available for the XBOX, PS2, Game Cube, PC and Game Boy Advance.  Set in 2003, you play as Sam Fisher, an elite operative gathering intelligence for Third Echelon, a top secret initiative of the NSA (National Security Administration).  You work alone during your missions with the support of a remote team who periodically feed you info and guidance throughout the missions.  If you are caught by the enemy, your country will deny your existence and any connection to you. Like a sliver of glass - small, sharp, and nearly invisible - you are a Splinter Cell. Splinter Cell is now highly renowned as being the ground-breaking game that introduced the world to true stealth gaming.  Light and shadows are the key elements in the game and play a vital role to your success.  Unlike most action games where you quickly run around guns blazing, in Splinter Cell you must be tactical in your approaches and slip by your enemies as if you were never there - creeping around in the shadows is the best approach.  However, sometimes you will be seen and have no choice but to eliminate any witnesses.  After doing so you should then elect to hide the bodies in the shadows as not to alert anyone of your presence. Causing a panic can easily create a real mess that will sound alarms and quickly end your mission - in a bad way.  This play with light and dark is very well executed and amplifies the immersive qualities of the game.Even now, years after its' initial release, Splinter Cell is still worth picking up and playing.  In fact, I originally purchased Splinter Cell for the Game Cube to take advantage of the exclusive connectivity features which enable the player to use sticky cams and have a tactical map displayed on their GBA, which is very neat by the way.  Only after playing the two following Splinter Cell games (Pandora Tomorrow and Chaos Theory) on Xbox did I then decide to buy the Xbox version of the original Splinter Cell.  I played through all of the missions again, this time including the exclusive downloadable maps from Xbox LIVE, and found it to be even more enjoyable than the fist time around.  Splinter Cell is a truly classic and timeless game that should be in every gamer's collection.
- The game itself is very interesting - the storyline is engaging and the controls are unique.  It's an RPG, which is quite a switch for Mario.  The major problem with this game is interactivity - not enough of it.  Specifically, there are far too many cutscenes that are not skippable.  Many of these cutscenes lead directly into a boss battle.  The most frustrating instance of this is just before the final boss battle - it takes about 10 minutes to get to the "real" fight from the prior save point.  This isn't a problem for the first time through the sequence, but if you lose 4 or 5 times, this just becomes a hassle and makes the game not really worth playing to see the end.  This is a major problem that most game designers have found work-arounds for, but Nintendo revealed its lack of RPG experience in this element.  It's an interesting game, but just make sure to win, or have a friend/sibling/(enemy?) skip through the dialog sequences for you if you get tired of them
- All I have to say is this game is not for 'EVERYONE'!! you have to be able to READ to play! Last time I checked not everyone can read. I bought this for my 13 year old son...who has autisum. He can master just about every game I get him but he can't read. So, for him this game was not much fun. I ended up playing more than he did and I didn't even enjoy it
- with games such as Grand theft auto: San Andreas, driv3r,true crime, etc. the competition is fierce and a game like this won't cut it. first when max talks it sounds like he is mumbling second the graphics suck third the game just sucks in general I am so glad I got this used for $6 I bet it was returned because it was too dumb for the previous owner. I saw it at EB games for only $5 that must mean it sucks and I read rockstar game the rights to remedy because the sales for the sequel max payne 2 were so low I have no clue how this was made a "greatest hit" play GTA or true crime instea
- I had high hopes on this game but I was disapointed. The controls are horrible and definitely the voice acting throughout 90% was bad. The story line was basically typical, it really didn't hold my interest for long. I did beat the game because I spent $50 on it the day it came out and I figured I would at least do that. I gave the game to a friend of mine after I beat it and he had the same opinion as I did. It's worth renting but definitely not worth buying. Hopefully those who decide to buy or rent this game can devote a good bit of time trying to learn the controls
- this game is just a waste of time everything about this crap game gave me a huge headache think god for advil they said that it took then a long time to make this game and for what its not worth nothing cameras are very bad it makes you dizzy when you play it there also a part in this game were you have to follow a maze in pich dark all you see is the lines from the maze you fall off almost every time plus that baby crying too just does it help you. like I said just a waste of time. plus max payne looks fuuny in this game take a good look at his face it looks like he from resident evil the walking dead. and they said it took then a long time to make this game. this game should have never been release
- this game is really bad I mean everything about it. they took so long to make this and for what.its just a waste off time and your money I gave it 1star because the guns are the best thing about this crap gam
+ totally awesome. my favourite game ever. the sound is revolutionary, the graphics are top notch, it is so real you'll freak. although, the PS2 version has four extra levels and thirty minutes of impressive new dialoge and cinematics, so I would buy the PS2 version if I were you. A must own for every gamer. it will change your life
+ When I first played this game I was shocked. Just of how good a stealth game could actually be. Its realistic in its ways that you can hide in the shadows and use the enviroment to take out your enemies. Its really fun also, suspense is one of the main things that happens in this game. You only use two guns during the whole game, the pistol and the rifle that has attachments. Good stuff. All you need is that, and you can take out a whole building full of enemies. You have to crouch, and move slowly so the enemy doesnt see you. A very realistic game and mi happy that this series of games got released. I highly recommend this game. Great storyline, and the last level is hecka hard!
- Driving physics are as unrealistic as they can get.  Obtaining licenses is extremely difficult, made worse by poor car physics.  Your heavy car easily bounces off light cars, while light cars easily derail your heavy car.  Turning the steering wheel only slightly produces heavy tire squeal, and that's with sports tires!Long gone are the ESPN-like replays of GT 2.  For some reason cars look thinner than before.  The analog tachometer has been reduced to just a bar across the screen.  The 3D mechanics can be headache prone, made worse by the poor physics of the cars.  Easily the most inadequate music ever.The game makes you start with a used model of only certain makes, which is nothing new.  However, it takes a long time to earn any money for a better car.  Only 7 horsepower upgrades make huge differences on the track?!  The game has mostly only newer models, almost none from a few years ago, unlike in GT 2.The only good thing about this game is that you don't have to drive all the time.  The B-Spec driving mode can win races for you.  Just leave for a few minutes and return to a victory screen.  This can help in skipping the painful, early parts of the game.The powertrain is still not modifiable.  Compression, bore, stroke, camshaft timing/overlap, valve size, and other engine characteristics are still not available.  With poor driving physics, engine modification would not have helped this game.Loading times are very long, with the most annoying loading indicator ever.  Constant auto saving feature is quick but can become annoying.  There is an excessive amount of confirmation screens.This game is a yet another disappointment, much like GT 3 was.  The makers of this game made it quite clear that if you want to know what the real cars drive like, you will have to drive them for real.  The Gran Tourismo series are over, unlikely to return to what they used to be.  I'm not a racing game fan, but only GT 2 was good enough for me to buy.  If you want good, car make-independent physics, you need to play Gran Tourismo 2.
+ Theres alot of rpg's out there that ppl stumble on or find with some research and this would be one of those.  By finding it, I found myself to be one happy camper when I got it and got it going.  You can play this for a very long time, or you can play this for a short amount of time, but I'm positive if your into dungeon crawl types you will love this one!My favourite part about this particular game is not having to have a key chart sitting in front of me at all times to glance at to remind me of what key does what.  I hate games that have so many controls that you cant just PLAY them w/o memorizing so many key strokes to even move much less play.There is also active forums with lots of info for this game even though its not a well known game here in the USA.All in all I recommend this highly.  Great graphics but you wont have to have a high end rig to run it.  There is already an addition to this out, replay value is high on this one
+ My television is in a completely different part of my house from my high speed internet connection, so while I wasn't thrilled to dish out extra money for this adapter, I have to say it was completely worth it.  Since I figured out how to set up my home wireless network and coordinate that with the 360, I get a very strong connection and have had no problems staying connected.The only issue I had was that when I first set up the adapter I didn't known enough about wireless networks to have everything clicking together.  At first the 360 would access Xbox Live, but was using other nearby wireless networks because I did not give the 360 the password ID to access my Linksys router.  I live in center city Philadelphia, and by default the adapter was picking up and using whatever open wireless networks were available.  The range must be good, because it would register about six or seven other networks of varying strengths.  Once I figured out that my Linksys router had a password code (I think it is a WEP number) I was able to punch the router's ID into the 360 and the 360 then automatically connected to the secure wireless router in my home.  I have never had a single issue since.  I don't think this delay in the optimal setup was anyone's fault but my own, since I was pretty ignorant of how wireless networks are set up but I have a feeling it may happen to others.All in all, I think that having a secure wireless network at home is what will become standard in the next few years.  This adapter works great, is small and disappears behind the console, reduces the clutter of wires, and allows you to keep your computer and high speed connection separate and distinct from your television area.  It was definitely a worthy purchase
+ Overall, I am pretty happy with this unit.  My only complaint is it is a little underpowered as far as grabbing my router signal.  My laptop has 5 bars in the basement, but I can typically only get two on the Xbox 360 with this adapter.  Because of this, it does drop its signal occasional with my Linksys WRT54GS Router.  However, it is also about 50 ft. away (assuming a direct line) with two floors and several walls in the way.  Still, using this unit was much better than figuring out how to hardwire my Xbox from two floors away.  Setup was a breeze.  I plugged it in (it snaps nicely into the back of the 360 and plugs into the nearby USB using a short cord), went to the network setting on the 360, selected the wireless slot, found my network, and typed in my WPA key for my router.  Done.  It took all of 5 minutes start to finish.Until buying this, I just dragged a 100' ethernet cable down the steps and through doorways anytime I wanted to connect to XBox Live.  What a pain!  This is not a perfect solution if you have a lot of space and stuff between your router and Xbox 360, but is fine for my needs, which mostly includes downloading from XBox Marketplace, and occasional online play.  If you are an avid XBox Live player, and you setup is like mine, you might want to consider a hardwire solution.  You may ocassionally lose your signal in the middle of a game.
+ All I had to do was plug it into the console and bring up XBox Live and it connected.  The only thing I did not like is that I would have preferred an Ethernet connection in lieu of the USB connection.  Other than that, the product worked as intended
- Being a Starsky and Hutch fan since I was a kid, I was looking forward to playing this. The graphics are "cartoon" horrible and the need for "VR" points becomes annoying after awhile. The bad guys are like something from a Chinese Kung Fu movie, you can shoot at them accurately and it takes all day to kill them...and that's with playing with a PS2 gun (I can't imagine shooting with a controller) which makes you lose the mission because you are down on "VR" points. The dialog gets annoying too and you can't skip hearing it either
+ Expensive but worth it - it just works.  No more wires
- This game has a great design and excellent/fun story BUT it was obviously not fully tested before it was released for the PC. Whenever there are more than about 5 enemies on the screen the game has horrible clipping/graphic slowdown issues. This means the bad guys keep shooting but your guy doesn't respond quickly to the commands. The clipping is so bad that sometimes I just wanted to find the CEO of Activision and shove this game down his throat. This CAN be a fun game, just don't play the PC version. Borrow someone's Xbox and play that version. This is another example of a greedy developer rushing a PC port to market without bothering to make sure it worked right
+ I enjoy having wireless...especially with broadband.  I have my router over 20 ft from the adapter yet my signal stays strong.  Set up is easy for most.  Although if you have a Linksys router WRT 54G ver. 2 get ready for some work.  It took me four calls before someone gave me the right advice.  Since then I have not had any problems.  A little expensive but worth it in the long run
+ I was using a basic Linksys wireless game adapter with my 360, and it worked fine. However, it needed to be connected to a PC for firmware updates (making it impossible for Mac users), and was generally more difficult to set up than the "official" adapter from Microsoft. I ended up getting this adapter on sale, and setting it up was a snap. It gets decent throughput, and saves some energy over an external adapter, because it only uses power when you have the Xbox 360 on. It was also nice to see that this supports WPA networks. If your time is valuable to you, this is probably worth the extra few dollars over similar products. You just snap it on, enter your network's password, and you're off.
+ I used a Linksys Media Center Extender to play and view my music and picture collection through my home theater. This product completley replaced the need for the Extender, was extremely easy to setup(WEP enabled) and works flawlessly. I do not find it overpriced at all given the capabilities for games and interacting with a Media Center PC. The music streaming is every bit as good. Setup was as simple as plugging in the adapter and entering the security code. Well done Microsoft!Tom - Las Vega
+ There are two major factions when it comes to video games, and if you weren't aware of their existence I'll be happy to illucidate for you. Group 1, and by far the most numerous, are the console gamers. Group number 2, the one to which I subscribe, is based on PC games. I'll be the first to admit that as a PC gamer I tend to view consoles with suspicion as my experiences are that they place looks, flash, and hefty price tags above game-play and plot. The console audience tends to be younger than the PC group, and these are the very aspects which appeal to them. So it was equal parts hesitation and excitement that I felt as I put this game onto my hard drive. For those not in the know, once upon a time, back in the early days of Microsoft's X-Box, there was this nifty game called "Halo", and my how the console gamers snapped it up. I saw the commercials on TV of course, and thought it looked pretty good, but felt it too bad that it was an X-Box title and not one available on my trusty ol' PC. "Halo" puts the player squarely in the armored shoes of Master Chief, a one of a kind super-marine engineered to bring the big guns on the Covenant, a consortium of deranged religious aliens bent on the destruction of all of humanity. No ship is allowed to go to Earth as it's location is a closely held secret which the Covenant wishes to possess at all costs. But Earth is losing the war, precipitating the creation of a new super soldier, the Spartan-II. Just before the Spartan's were to be used on the Covenant's home planet the latter launches a surprise attack on the facility and destroys all but one; You. In a gambit to elude pursuit the last ship left, the Pillar of Autumn, jumps into hyperspace and ends up in orbit around a strange ringworld named Halo, but are immediately attacked by their pursuers, who seem to have tracked down the Autumn in no time. Now, complaint number one I have of this game stems from the fact that *everything* I just described is not taken from the game itself. It comes from the game's manual. A plot this interesting should at least have been included in the opening scenes. C'mon Microsoft, you have the money, pony it up to spruce up the introduction. It's a good plotline, so don't waste it on the manual, which will only be kept in a desk drawer of some juvenile for the next 10 years and forgotten until next decade's spring cleaning.Plot (and first gripe) now aside, let's focus on the game itself. I refuse to judge a game by it's age, as too many do nowadays...for instance, I still play the original Half-Life and think the plot and game-play more than make up for the aged graphics. The game looked fine on my PC and I never experienced anything close to screen lag. The colors and contours of the alien world and ship hallways are nicely rendered and the sound and ambient noise are above average. The music itself has nice choral sequences (such as featured on the menu screen) to downright cheap MIDI sounding music, which felt out of sorts with the rest of the game. The weapons selection is small but surprisingly good, and for any given situation you'll likely have access to the weapon/s needed to surmount it. I particularly like the Plasma Pistol with it's supercharged shots, as well as that everlasting mainstay of FPS games, the shotgun. The ability to drive vehicles is included in the game, something that separates Halo from most other FPS's, and it is a lot of fun. In particular I loved driving the Scorpion tank, which demolishes everything in it's path. You can also fly around in an enemy Banshee light fighter, which made getting past a couple of levels that much easier. The game's plot flows smoothly and the voice acting is pretty good.And now for the gripes. Right off the bat I will say that level design has to be the single biggest detraction from this game. Beautiful outdoor environments are used in this game, but not *nearly* enough. You'll spend most of it traversing hallway after hallway, which connect to rooms that look *identical* to the one you just left. Doing this 2-3 times is enough, but when you spread out a level that runs outwards of up to 3 hours of the *same thing*, it gets reaaaally stale. Case in point, in the chapter/s in which you spend time with the Monitor traveling through the Library. This section of the game was draining and seemed without end. It wasn't fun, just stressful. The level in which the player is introduced to the Flood felt much the same, although it was still a lot of fun.Vehicles are fun, but require the mouse to steer. This obviously is a remnant of the X-Box, where players had to steer the Warthog with the control toggle-thing, but I found that mostly it had me skidding against walls and occasionally flipping. The Ghost was the only vehicle I was able to use the strafe keys on to assist with steering. The enemies themselves do tend to get a little stale after a while, and during my first couple of hours of playing I wondered what I had gotten myself into. The Grunts, little pointy-backed gnomish aliens, spend most of their time running away and speaking an Ewok-accented English. It's very distracting and considering the nature of the other baddies they seemed a little out of place. The lumbering Hunter, who is super armored, was also incredibly stupid. At first I had trouble negotiating them, but soon learned that by employing certain attack patterns I could easily waste one in under a minute. The other aliens tend to use good combat tactics and I found dealing with them more difficult. The plot itself, which I classify as very good, bordering on great, kept me interested. It ain't Half-Life, but it works well enough to have my curiousity piqued about Halo 2, which I might have to go ahead and buy in the near future. I'm sure that had Halo been released on the PC first, which is what was originally intended, it'd have left a recognizable mark on the FPS shooter on that platform. So that's that. A very good game and one in which I look forward to the continuing storyline of Master Chief, killer extraordinaire!
- I thougt there would be a better story line, and what I found was very disappointing.The boss (McGruder) was easier to beat than the boss in the Matrix-Path to neo. I mean, I paid good money for this game on the premise that it was a quality game; obviously I was wrong
- I plugged the receiver into my game controller and followed the directions to get the controller to communicate with the receiver.  The receiver light kept blinking which means that it didn't recognize the controller. After several tries I decided that the product is defective and returned it
+ What else needs to be said. Even with a low-end Graphics card this Masterpiece is FUN! Perfect combination for a laptop/notebook. Too bad Sir William Gates won't allow a PC version of Halo 2. Well anyways seeya in Halo 3 Deathmatc
+ It is a fun "first person", shooter game. The graphics are decent and the story line's ok. The game's play time is about 15 - 20 hours
- this just sucks the main person just keeps running around.He just keeps running and or walking which is controlled thru the key board.no fwd bike control,he won't peddle, but gos backwards quite well.Tryed different setups reloads and nothing worked.Atleast I bought it used and for not much money.Maybe ill find a fix and try it again later
+ I LOVE this game!  The storyline is wonderful!  I guess if you feel bored with the campaign, just go looking for easter eggs!  But what I LOVE is playing multi-player!  And someone did bash the multi-player, but there are TONS of rooms that will kick you out for cussing and/or killing your teammates!   I've had this game for years, and I never get tired of playing online!  Actually...it's kind of addicting...
+ Love this game. Great story line. Just make sure your computer can handle it
+ Action,action, and satisfaction! Totally awesome and entirtaining. This videogame will rock your world! Cool new characters and weapons tactics and awsomeness
- I rented this game for my 3 year old.  Who loves the movie.  He tried to play it.  He like it.  I tried to play itandgot to the dancing part.  I couldn't get past it.  I tried for 5 days.  My rental time was up.  I returned it.  I haven't rented it since.  This game is way too hard to beat.  And my 3 year old got bored with it real fast.  I would NOT recommend this game to anyone.  Don't waste your money buying it.  Unless you are an expert with video games.  I'm just thankful that I rented it instead of buying it
- I rented this game and returned it the next day because between my and my friend we could not get past the dancing scene we tried for like an hour and couldn't get past it don't waste your time or patience with this annoying game
+ I decided to buy STAR WARS REPUBLIC COMMANDO on Xbox for my son, because he won't let me play my PC version.  Come to find out it seems like it plays easier on Xbox. This game is by far one of the best I've ever played.  It's awesome.  I find it very exiting and actually feels like being part of a combat squad. Everyone in the team knows to be pro-active, rather than reactive.  I haven't seen a game yet, where the squad members react to direct or indirect fire as these Commandos do it.  You don't move with your team, they'll do their job.  You can also redirect their orders and they will follow orders to the letter.  Being able to "inject" them with Bacta, makes the game a whole lot better that just "finding a med kit", and on the other hand, while you're injured, being rescued by your crew definitely gives you the feeling that you are a TEAM!!! The only regret (just a small one) is that the game was so short (or at least it felt like it). It only has three major campains, and with a game that is so much fun, it seemed like time flew by. I can only hope that LUCASARTS decides to make a Republic Commando II (maybe, based on the missions of OMEGA squad)...here's hoping.  I definintely recommend this game, for Squad-based combat or STAR WARS fans alike, you'll get a kick out of it.  I'm definintely a fan of "Delta Squad, Republic Commandos
+ I'm 15 and I have Star Wars: Battlefront 1 and 2, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 1 and 2, this game, and I'm getting LEGO Star Wars in the mail any day now.  I really like Star Wars: Battlefront 2 and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 1, but this is a game that is hard to place as to how much I like it. I got this game 2 days ago after work at like 2 PM and I played it until like 1 AM and then I woke up the next day at about 9 AM and I beat it at maybe 1 PM.  So it took me about half a day to beat.  I was really mad when I beat it because I was having fun and it just suddenly ended.  And it was a really stupid ending too!  The Good:- You have a really good control over your squad with a variety of different orders such as telling a squad mate to set up a sniping position in one spot or telling your slicer to slice open a door for you.  This is good so that you don't have to do everything yourself and you don't have to rely on your squad to give you covering fire when it takes a whole minute to slice into a computer data base.-The weapons are pretty sweet and they are ones that you have never really seen before (except for maybe thermal detonators or a wookie bowcaster.)-If you become incapacitated, you can tell your squad to come revive you, or if you don't feel like fighting, tell them to just maintain their current orders and revive you after the fighting is done.-The way to heal yourself is a bacta station, which I think is better than running over a health container.-The AI is good so your squad actually knows how to fight.The Bad:-The game is a lot shorter than I expected with only about 3 different planets/ships-There are only about 5 different enemies: Battle droids, Super Battle droids, Trandoshans, Geonosians, and Magna Guards.-The enemies all act the same in every battle.-Super Battle droids are really annoying in a fight because they are really tough to beat if you just have a blaster rife (unless you're a noob and play it on easy.)-Telling your squad to do things gets repetative after a while.-The ending sucks.-Once you beat it, you can only play the game over on a harder setting, which is not really that fun, or play with your friends on multiplayers, which isn't fun either.  So you just put it back on the shelf for a while until you're bored and feel like playing it again.So, all-in-all, this is a really fun game until you beat it.  So I suggest that you "pace" yourself.
- Pointless quests with no real conclusions. CTD every 30-45 minutes. Lengthy dialoge with no real human attachment. All in all a VERY unpolished product, even with the patch. If your favourite aspect of the first game was the story then do not buy this game
- Such great visuals and I love most of the Star Wars RPG/Shooters, BUT, I cant believe this is a point and click game.  I was hoping KOTOR2 would have implimented a normal battle engagement.  Theres nothing worse than toggling thru menus etc during an intense battle and actually having to turn around, click the target, then engage someone else after the kill.  The days of Boulder's Gate point-n-click should be over, but I guess theres a crowd for this type of game-play.  Still a good game, but dissapointed
+ This game is pretty cool u are in a 4 man squad made up of you the Leader (Orange) Scorch the demoshing guy (yellow) Fixer the guy who hacks into stuff (green) and Sev the sniper (red). I in this game it basicly is the battle of geonsis and wht happens from there to eposode 3. And amazingly it is almost just like halo! Ad in some parts has more blood to it like when you stab a alien with your knife the blood shoots on your visor (yes this game has more than robots). anyhow this game is becoming out dated so by it here. you'll love it 
+ this game is very good it jsut sucks u in and u cant quit, and before u know it, it is don
- lucas should be ashamed to stamp his name on this turkey. do not play on the xbox 360. you will experience random sound shreiks, resolution issues, too-lonng load times. and overall this is a really buggy and perplexing product. why? the first was very good
+ I throughly enjoyed this game. The voice acting may not be the greatest, but I think the game-play is really well done and the atmospheres are fantastic. The controls take some getting used too and are not for everyone. They are a problem and could have been better to control, surprisenly I can do it very well. The major problem I have is that as the game progresses it gives you less times to save, so you have to go through almost an entire level (though short) and complete it WITHOUT saving once. That is so stupid because if you die at the end you have to do the entire level over again, that is the dumbest thing ever in a video game.  I just feel it's unfair for the game makers to make a fairly difficult level then make you do it over and over if you slip and die toward the end. Stupid, stupid, stupid. The levels can be a bit difficult if you're not one to be quick on the trigger. And as much I gripe on the camera angles, they're useful in stopping Max at the end a hall, swing the camera around and see if an enemy is around the corner, waiting on the steps, right inside the next room, etc. It gives you a heads up and makes it easier to stay alive.However, I still really liked it. I didn't enjoy MP2 as much, but MP3 (which should end the series I think) should, (re: SHOULD) be much better. I'm looking forward to it.
+ From the commercials, Max Payne was a third-person shooter with a twist; the twist being able to kill mobsters, junkies and mercenaries in slow motion. Truly, one gets hooked on being able to leap backward in slow motion whilst rapidly firing dual handguns to put the kibosh on those that are trying to do the same to you.Aside from the slow-mo, Max Payne is essentially a third-person shooter whereupon you take control of the title undercover cop turned anti-hero, Max Payne. The story unfolds dramatically as you delve into the game. The jist of it is Max's wife and baby were brutally murdered by junkies and he's on the hunt for revenge. The plot widens, thickens and nearly bursts as you progress through the game. One can never tell who truly is on Max's side until the moment the credits roll at the end.The bottom line is this game is very much based on the slow motion "bullet time". Gunfights would be nearly impossible without the ability to slow them down to aim and fire with apt precision. That brings about the issue with controls. One of the cons of the game are the controls. Many times have I fallen off balconies and ledges due to the analog stick making Max move just so to the right. The heavy load times can also add to the agony, especially when after over a dozen tries one still cannot overcome the obstacles in your way.The game is definitely run on a sliding scale. The chapters start out a cake-walk and progress to a veritable teeth-grinder. At one point, I was so fed up and enraged by the game that I had to go outside and take a walk. If, however, you can take the time out to relax, focus and be patient, you should have little problem with the game. As for guns - there are lots of them. And more ammo than you can handle. Oftentimes you'll find a gun you really like and stick with it, in the process having to leave ammo behind on the corpses of your enemies. That being said, guns don't hold as much ammo as one would want, especially given the fact there is a huge surplus of ammunition abounds. Max also chews up painkillers like chocolate chips in order to heal himself - proof that he's not a guy to be messed with!I, personally, was very much hooked on it. The cutscenes are treated in a comic book style with dialogue and inner-soliloquies lifted from a Dashiell Hammett novel. However, simply put, one will either love or detest this game. I was reeled in by it, but am very glad I've beaten and seen the end of it. However, if you just cannot get enough Max Payne, there are two additional difficulty settings unlocked after beating it along with a third, even harder setting unlocked after those.The game was in parts extremely easy and in other parts extremely challenging. I wouldn't recommend picking this game up unless you're ready for oftentimes graphic violence, innuendo and potty-mouthery. I also wouldn't recommend picking up this game if you're not ready to be put on the verge of ripping your hair out in frustration. It is, however, conquerable and you'll very much be pleased once you do overcome the challenges
- I BOUGHT THIS GAME WHEN IT WAS $50 BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT GAME. I WAS WRONG. YOU DONT GET A LIGHTSABRE UNTIL FAR INTO THE GAME AND ALL THE ADVERTISMENTS SHOWS YOU WITH A LIGHTSABRE. THE GAME IS EXTREMELY BUGGY AND HAS POOR GRAPHICS. I AM A HUGE STARWARS FAN AND WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE NO MATTER HOW BIG OF A STARWARS FAN THEY ARE.                     DONT BUY THIS GAME
+ This is a very flashy, very fun car chase shooting game. You get over 20 different vehicles and guns. The TV-like game-play makes for a good story line. There's hardly any dialogue in the cut scenes, but this was one of the first PS2 games. Gran Theft Auto:$50. Driv3r:$30. Starsky and Hutch: priceless
+ I haven't tried it with the light gun yet, but even with 2 dual-shocks this is a unique and accessible 2-player co-op game (one drives, one shoots) with decent replay value.  I don't think the difficulty can be increased, but it's fun to go back and beat your old scores and play with the unlocked cars.  I suppose it could be finished in a rental, but personally I find it's nice to own some simple co-op games like this that you can pop in and play right away if a friend shows up, esp. if that friend is not a hardcore gamer.  as a 1-Player game it starts to feel like GTA-lite after awhile, although for kids this one is better because it lacks the mature content
+ what I mean here is about 3 and a half stars which in my little scheme of things means the good pretty clearly outweighs the bad and I recommend it with a bit of enthusiasm. 4 star games are very rare for me and this game made a good run at it. I can't even imagine a 5 star game. I've come to think there are too many inherent problems in games for 5 stars.anyway, ahem, this is about gun. a very nice game I looked forward to a lot. I played it just after it came out and hopefully havent forgotten too much about it.the positives:graphics! this seems to be a bit controversial as some people complain about them, but frankly I sometimes think people overrate realism and detail. gun's detail was not like, I don't know, half life 2 or something. I didn't repeatedly go "wow, unbelievable todays technology!" but I really enjoyed them. they were pretty to look at, they set the scene well and they were extremely refreshing- bright, colorful, open western vistas instead of dark, gloomy, tense, industrial, claustrophobic and filled with horror creatures and commandos like, I don't know, 95% of all shooters. it was lovely to ride my horse around spotting buffalo and hot springs and such. I appreciated that quite a bit.difficulty: well, I can't remember if this game had difficulty levels. but I like difficulty levels and make a bee line for the easy choice! I do not like dying! even if I can reload right away, and I am not too great at these games. well, so, up until the last part of the game (more about that later) I had no real problems and generally felt clever and talented but not coddled and unchallenged. the poker was too easy though and I could not get the hunting and gave up on it part way through (I thoroughly completed everything else).characters/voice acting: pretty good characters helped by superb voice acting. I don't want any spoilers here so I'll just say the quality of the characters was let down by the storyline, but I still liked them. and they looked pretty good to me.game-play: it was quite fun and varied. it had some of the best bullet time ever (called quickdraw or something). I loved how you could flick target to target with a single button which not only made me feel more impressive but also raised the speed of mowing down enemies in a way that made it less ridiculous that I was beating 11 people in a gunfight. the horse riding was done very well and it was nice to pony express. I liked that poker was in it though found it a bit limited, and both the ranching and mining were really nice and helped fill out the world and the variety of things you do.length: I may be an exception, but the vast majority of games go too long for me. the feel of them and the things I do in them become redundant and I don't finish, so I like that gun seemed manageable. for the most part I was pleasantly full when I finished though perhaps finishing things was a little too cut and dried, like the way you can get every upgrade possible.the negative:story: it should have gone a bit lighter, I mean, it seemed to think it was some powerful clint eastwood directed western but unfortunatly computer games are not capable of pulling off anything nearly that sophisticated. they just have too much on their plate vis a vis game-play and choice. the cutscenes and acting were nice, and it started solidly, but storywise it progressively deteriorated, or I guess was completely unable to fufill its set up. it gets a little hard to discuss without spoilers but, well, more romance would have been nice and the boss battle that goes on and on was not just difficult for me (remember how I hate that!), but it was irritatingly stupid, and senseless to the reality of the game.conclusion: wow, only one big negative, but the huge, long, ending boss battle really bugged me. really, good game though. oh, and by the way, I have a pretty midlevel computer (and fading fast) and didn't have any real technical problems, maybe a couple of ugly frame slowdowns, but mostly it was smooth. that's just, you know, for what that's worth. anyway, if some of what I am talking about makes sense to you go try this game out
+ The XBOX 360 Live 12 month kit is the best deal for anyone who needs to sign up or renew their Live account, even if you do have the headset. The card itself is $50, and the points, bonus game, and $20 dollars off a new game (limited time offer) easily helps to make your money back. Even if they didn't include the rebate, it would still be less than buying these parts separate. In fact, it's almost like you're getting a headset for free!So, like I said, if you need live, buy.Also, this is the bundle which someone earlier stated was cheaper at Best Buy. I checked, and he was mistaking the card for the kit
+  This game remains one of my favourite games of all time.I'm an old school game, I've played computer games since I had an atari st with cartridge.I played the other GTA games, I liked them very much, they are all addictive. This one, this one is trully the jewel in the crown.There are many things I could say, but I just don't want to repeat the same waffle. It's a great game, the characters are all superb, voiced by great actors. Ray Liotta is just on fire as Tommy Vercetti. I'm still suprised they got all of this talent, there seems to be no stone un turned, even Blondie get's a minor part.This is many thumbs way up. Indeed, it's notorious, it's not for minors, though no doubt there are more minors played this than adults. A lot of it's subject matter are just for kicks, just teh kind of amusement we seek because it's the kind of thing we would never normally do in our wildest dreams; The other part, inmo, is jsut sheer style. I can't recommend this title enough. The only possible downside to it, and this is just being picky is the loading times between various parts of the city. This was eliminated in San Andreas, but this one is the one."I run this town! ME!!" - Tommy Vercetti
+ I am a kid, I will NOT reveal my age, but I have been playing GTA for a few years. It has entertained me so much. I just got the PS2 version, and I am ordering the PC version. Here is my rating, in detail.1 - Horrible2 - Bad3 - So-So4 - Good5 - ImpressiveGameplay - 4I'm sorry. I can't say that GTA Vice City has no glitches, because it does have many glitches. Other than that, the game-play is perfect. Kept me busy for hours.Audio - 5HOLY. The sound in GTA Vice City is so cool, the 80's radio, the realistic firearm sounds, the car's engine, the pitterpatter of your shoes..wow. That's all I can say.Graphics - 3GTA has never, I repeat NEVER took full advantage of graphics. They have always been low quality for their time, but good enough so that it's playable. It's pretty modern.Missions - 5The missions go in deep, and affect the storyline in ways you can't imagine. One even involves going around in an ice cream truck and selling ice cream with drugs in it. It's vulgar, but fun.Overall - 4.1 out of a possible 5. A highly ranked game in my book. I hope you enjoy it too
+ Man, I am sick of people mentioning the violence and cursing and sex that's in this game.  DUH!!!  This is as redundant as saying the sun is bright and hot.  I don't even see what the big deal is.  The gore in it isn't exactly realistic (the blood splattering and gushing isn't that great-looking) and I've seen much more "disturbing" games.  The violence is almost like cartoon violence in some ways.  It isn't really that big a deal.  There is some very moderate cursing and there's some sex.  Yes, you can pick up hookers.  No, you don't see any action.  Yes, there's a strip club and sluttily dressed women but these aren't exactly real-looking people.  Just lighten up.  If you don't want your 8-year-old exposed to it then don't buy it for him but I better not see your hipocritical a** buying him an R or even PG-13 movie!  This really is no different than watching some PG-13 movies and any R movie.  In fact, they may be worse.  I think you should relax if the kid is 12 and that's being generous.Now enough with that bulls**t!  On to the game!  It's great.  What else do you expect?  You could play this game for hours and never get bored.  You can do whatever you want: steal a car, speed around town, run over people, do drive-bys, rob a store, kill a person for no reason with a variety of weapons, see how long you can evade the law, do a mission, do a sub-mission (such as the paramedic), pick up a hooker and get some health, etc. etc. etc.  There's plenty of side missions to do and those are what'll take up the most time, not any of the storyline or asset missions.  The hardest ones are the paramedic, vigilante, firefighter, Brown Thunder and Pizza Boy missions as far as I am concerned because there you have a time limit and if you're vehicle blows up you're f**ked and have to start all over again.  You'll take a long time getting all the Hidden Packages, Rampages and all that stuff but that's not so hard because it's not something that's really "hard".  Just tedious.  There's also some race missions that are tough but they can be done with some persistence.The controls are great.  The driving's excellent and so is the on-foot ones.  The auto-aim works easily enough though you sometimes target the ones you don't want to, but you can get around this without too much difficulty.  The boats are harder to control though and the helicopters can be tricky.  But the boats are the worst since they have a habit of over-accelerating and over-steering.  But the controls in general are good enough so that you can pretty quickly get used to them, and before you know it, you'll be cruising around town like a pro.The graphics are quite nice.  The cars are very realistic-looking.  In fact, after playing this if you go outside and look at real cars they'll remind you of the ones in the game.  You'll even feel like driving them like you did in the game!  But obviously you won't because you're not as stupid and f**ked up like that guy who killed those cops and then like a p**sy blamed the game for making him do it.  Don't listen to those a**holes.  It's all a bunch of crap.  The only complaints I have would be on the people.  They could look better and the blood could be a little better too, especially when it gushes from someone you shoot.  I would like to see more blood too.The camera angles are the main flaw of the game.  Sometimes you'll want it to point in a different direction so you can see what you're shooting at.  Another problem is when you're in the helicopter.  That can get screwed up with you turn around and the angle has to catch up with you.  On foot if you're not auto-targeting you you have a button to adjust the camera angle to where you're facing but when you're in the vehicles not so.  The only time this really is a problem though is in the chopper.The sound is excellent.  Even the sounds themselves are nice.  You have great voice acting by some well-knowns and even nonwell-knowns, but it's all fantastic.  The dialogue is fantastic too.  You'll hear people on the street talking amongst themselves and they'll do stuff such as tell you to move, sometimes not so nicely, when you park a car in the middle of the flow of traffic.  They'll scream and plead for their lives or even taunt you when you point a gun at them or attack them.  Your character will even say things to people, like when he steals their car or kills them, such as, "My need is greater than yours," or, "It's only money."  It's great!The humor value on this game is top-notch and that has a lot to do with the sounds I mentioned above, as well as how fun it is to kill people for whatever reason, if there's a reason, but also with the RADIO!  I can't believe more people aren't commenting on this.  This is one of the highpoints in this game just like on GTA3, only this time they don't make up all their own songs, which is bad or good depending on how you look at it.  I love cruising around town listening to KChat, VRock or VCPR, that latter of which is the funniest of all.  I usually listen to these because they are the funniest (talk radio is obviously funnier than music stations even though there is talk from the DJ's and call-in listeners and the commercials) and because I like rock music and they play actually good bands like Iron Maiden and Anthrax.  They do make up some of their own music.  I know they make up an in-game band, which you actually can do missions with, called Love Fist, a group of drunken Scotts.  But the radio is hilarious, not just the talk radio but the commercials especially as well ("'Knife After Dark'--Rated R for 'Retarded'.")The game has some flaws but overall it's d**m near perfect.  The makers of the game basically took all they did in GTA3 and added to it but failed to really fix these few flawss I mentioned.  But they're nothing in comparison to the overall fun this game provides.  There is at least over 100 hours, even if you're familiar with the over-all game-play from GTA3, if you try to do 100% or at least something close to that (I have no idea how I'm gonna complete all those submissions).  Look, this is one of the easiest decisions you'll ever make in your life.  Just buy the d**m game.And if that's not enough to convince you, as one of the radio characters in the game, Jeremy Robar, says, "Just listen to these endorsements.  And remember, these people volunteered.  They aren't being paid much.
+ After playing Grand Theft Auto III, I thought there was no way Rockstar could top themselves.  In fact, when the advance word for this game got out, I actually thought this was nothing more than an ADD-ON for GTA3.  Stupid thought, I know; on the whole, GTA:VC is bigger, badder, and more audacious than GTA3 ever was.So, here's the story:In 1986, Tommy Vercetti -- a hitter for the Forelli crime family in Liberty City -- is finally released from prison.  Sonny Forelli, his boss, immediately sends him down to Vice City to close a major drug deal being handled by Ken Rosenberg, a shyster lawyer and the Forellis' contact.  No sooner is the deal closed than gunmen break it all up, kill everyone but Tommy and Ken, and take both the drugs and the cash.  Now, Tommy has to recover the money for Sonny...but before long, he decides to make a name for himself in this town.  The setting is pure '80s excess, through and through.  If you take the bottomless amoral corruption of Scarface, the day-glo polyester fashion of Miami Vice, and the innate cheesy greed of Ronald Reagan's 1980s American culture, you'll have Vice City.  You'll see it in the fashion sense of the citizens, the local architecture, and the cars tooling around on the road.  You'll even hear it in the radio stations, which boast an array of heavy metal, dance, Latino, and bubblegum pop music the like of which you haven't even thought of since the '80s.  I swear; try listening to one of the radio stations and see if the memories don't come flooding back.  The voice acting is, as usual, superb.  Ray Liotta did an outstanding job bringing Tommy Vercetti to life, and in making an otherwise loathsome sociopath into a strangely likable character.  And there are others as well; Burt Reynolds, Dennis Hopper, Gary Busey, Lee Majors, Fairuza Balk, and Robert Davi all turn in great performances.  But Philip Michael Thomas, who played Don Johnson's partner Tubbs on Miami Vice, gets special mention; in more ways than one, his character -- Lance Vance -- is the one to keep an eye on.While the main story missions only take up a third of the game itself, it's the addition of a new feature that not only rounds things out, it also adds length to the game, and really makes you feel like you're establishing a criminal empire.  They're called asset properties.  At a certain point in the game, you have the option of buying certain businesses.  Once you buy one of these asset properties, and you complete its mission strand, that business will start generating a daily amount of money for you to pick up.  Some of them are perfectly legitimate, such as the taxi company or the nightclub.  Others are a little sketchy, like the boatyard or the strip club, but others are absolutely illegal, like the protection rackets, the "ice cream" company, or the car showroom.  They add a great amount of depth, and they let you establish contacts across town.  Needless to say, once Sonny Forelli comes to town to "check up" on you, make no mistake...he's now in YOUR town.So, if you feel the need to get away from it all and indulge your inner Tony Montana, book a trip to Vice City.  Like San Andreas, it's a great place to visit and unwind...and also like San Andreas, you'll be glad YOU don't live there
- First off I just want to say that I've read "The Secret of the Old Clock" and it made this game even more boring because I knew the basic outline.I see in an above review an adult of the age 35 loved it, which I can understand. But I'm 15 and I found this game OVERLY boring. The puzzles were way too easy, and driving around in the horribly done car part of the game made me want to quit playing. It says youll get a pay if you do some chores for people...I didnt get anything. Although I love herinteractive and and I love all the other nancy drew games I would highly reccomend you don't waste $19.00 on it. I would only reccomend getting it if it was in a value pack of Nancy Drew games
+ With the Wii right around the corner, people are rushing to get one. Some preordered it while some others (including me) are camping out for it. But some worry about how old school is fitting into the next-gen world of gaming and its completely wireless interaction. Sure, sideways Wii controllers are S/NES controllers, but what of gamecubes? I am happy to say that I have gotten a chance to play around with the Wii before anyone else. And yes, the wavebird Receiptor will fit flawlessly under the gamecube controller flap on the Wii. It looks pefectly at home there. Rejoice gamers! Pick up your wavebirds and play on
+ the wavebird can really take a beating. there are 2 dogs in my house that drool all over them and two infants that pick them up and throw them and they still work fine. plus the game that ip[lay all the time is Super Smash Bros. Melee and the controller is still fine after all the button mashing. I also have a wireless xbox controller and there is one feature that reely helps that I wish was on the wavebird. After 10 min of no use my xbox controller automatically shuts its self off which saves the battery. its too bad the wavebird doesnt have this. but overall its a great controlle
- I was excited to play this game because I wanted to play a detective-like game.  unfortunately, this game is very kid-like.  here's an example.  the first non auto-generated task is to solve some puzzles for a guy.  these are the simple kind of puzzles you could find in a children's word game book.  I easily got all of them except 1, meaning I couldn't progress past this point.  no problem for me, because by this time I didn't want to!  I'm not saying it's a bad game, it's just probably not a good game for grownups.
- Sure, the graphics and sound ARE nice, but this game is very linear and very forgiving- too forgiving. You can save and reload just about constantly, so long as there aren't monsters nearby and things are made kinda dummy-proof so you can't make any significant mistakes. As a result, I never really felt like I was taking much of a chance doing anything. The dialogue is mostly a matter of clicking responses until you can't click anymore and there's not much bad consequence to clicking them in any ol' order. There's really only one path through the different areas of the game and nothing ever respawns. You can also adjust the difficulty levels from very easy to very difficult but the experience and treasure don't adjust accordingly. This means if a fight is too tough after a couple reloads you can make it very easy and still get the same rewards you would have gotten when it was hard. <yawn> Maybe I'm just a little jaded from playing online games like Everquest for so long. In online, realtime games with other humans playing around you there is much more of an unpredictable, and more importantly uncontrolable, and much more exciting environment to play in. I got so bored with this that I actually stopped playing while close to completing the very last area of the game. I just didn't care anymore. This game requires very little thinking or strategizing
+ I bought a nintendo ds so I can play super mario brothers for ever like I was when I was a kid .. Its amazing that they brought the villans back from the first 3 marios when we were younger ... My 4.5 year old cousin even was hooked on it and I had to buy him a DS along with mario so he could play it after I left to go back home ...
+ I have always loved Mario, and when I purchased my new Nintendo DS Lite, I bought this with it. This game is absolutely amazingly fun! The graphics, sound, and the game itself are incredible. This game is good for any adult or child. Although for a younger child, it might be a bit more difficult and possibly frustrating. ;) With this game you have to try some of the harder levels over again, and possibly again after that. But every time you try again, you understand something new about the level, and it really is fun. There also are the features of becoming Mega Mario and Mini Mario which mixes things up every once and a while. This game is wonderful, definitely a great buy.
+ I bought the game for my daughter, but I play it more than she does. This game will give you hours of enjoyment if you love Super Mario Bros
- On paper, the idea of a 24 video game sounds like a great idea, and upon first glance of it, it seems like it's firing on all cylinders.  Featuring all the major players from the series reprising their roles (Kiefer Sutherland, Dennis Haysbert, Elisa Cuthbert, etc.) and a storyline and tone and atmosphere that captures the feel of the show, 24: The Game falls apart once you get further into it.  The missions are repetitive, the animation and graphics are jumpy and glitched, and the controls are unresponsive to say the least.  Targeting enemies is a chore at times as you use the analog sticks, but the targeting along with just plain moving gets incredibly cumbersome thanks to a camera that seems to want to work against you.  Some of this could be forgiveable, but the further you get through 24 the more rushed the game feels.  It's a shame too, considering how innovative the series was in it's early life and everything the game had going for it.  If more polish was put into it, 24: The Game could have been something special, but as it is, it's only recommended as a rental for fans of the series
+ I loved the game and the side scrolling was a nostalgic step back in time for me.  The game play was difficult at times.  Honestly, I beat the a game in less than 2 weeks (with a grad student schedule and immunology test in the middle).  Finishing everything completely (all levels and all star coins) was a challenge in and of itself.  But it reminded me of the GTA series because after you beat the game there is really nothing to do anymore in the mushroom kingdom. The minigames are amazing time wasters.  I find myself playing them when waiting 5 minutes for other people etc.  I have had limited experience with the multi-player, but it was VERY fun of you have a friend with a DS. Best feeling- seeing the 3 stars next to my saved game and getting to level 176 of the 'where's waldo' minigame
+ ...which is ok.  I think if they made this game fully controlled by the stylus and touchpad it would make it a bit wacky. Sort of like Mario 64 DS.  And like Mario Kart, you have the 2nd screen as your map.  But you can also use it to use items whenever you like and also jump from area to area whenever you want.That's really the jist of this game when it comes to NEW features.Someone wrote "loosely based" off the old 2D side scroller Marios, but actually this is very much based off them entirely.  The only difference is that the environments and characters are in full 3D yet still side scrolling view.  Which is a nice touch watching the 3D models move around like that.  Other then that it's a nice update to the old classics.Especially big Mario which you never do get much to play with thanks to the use of a giant mushroom.  And vice versa a mini mushroom that causes Mario to shrink (and the only way to access the other levels by defeating the enemy bosses as Mini Mario).  There's also a new shell costume of which Mario dons, but can quickly get out of control if you run to fast and he spins all over.All in all it's a very fun game, entertaining, but not very hard, which is good for the young folks but those reminiscent of the old days know how hard it was to beat a Mario game back then, and this was surprisingly easy.  Luckily the game is packed with mulitplayer features and mini games to add to the value and they do.  Not all are entirely fun, but the majority do make use of the touchpad and make up for not using it much throughout the game.  Playing 2 player will always be fun of course, unfortunately it's not WIFI so you have to be within range of someone else with the game
- I guess the first thing I'll say is that I got Jedi Academy BEFORE I got this game. I was HUGELY dissaponted. I really liked Jedi Academy but this game is not that great. I have cheat codes so I can have all wepons and all amo and I can be undying. There are partes in this game that are INSAINLY tought. There are way to many puzzles - I don't mind puzzles but there are simply way to many. And some on them are insainly hard. I would recomend you to get Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy - way better the puzzles aren't insain and you get to choose what you look like and....well I could go on but I'll leave it there. If you aredy have Jedi Academy and you want another star wars game that is $20 then you sould get Battlefront thats anoter great game. Just don't get this game.
- I used my remote all of about 8 times before it stopped working.  Even with the proprietary dongle inserted into a controller slot you cannot control this thing with a controller, you must use the remote control.  When you take the dongle out with a DVD in, a screen will come up telling to reinsert, so if either the dongle or the remote get slightly injured or malfunction, then you've just wasted thirty bucks.  I feel quite ripped off.  With the low cost of DVDs nowadays, it's a MUCH better idea to buy a standalone IMHO, you can get a good progressive scan for about $30 or $40, which comes out to about the same price.As a side, it is also EXTREMELY annoying that you can't turn on, or off the device with the remote, you must go up to box to do it yourself, especially annoying if you just want to watch a DVD in your bed and crash afterwards.  All in all the value proposition offered by this product is very low considering the similarly priced alternatives
+ GTA III rules  but its not the greatest game ever thats why it gets overall of 4 but it still is awesome but GRAND THEFT AUTO VICE CITY RULES EVEN HARDER!!! Xbox version is best
+ Castlevania: Curse of Darkness is a game that even the die-hard Castlevania fan might not much get into. Lament of Innocence wasn't a terrible game, but it wasn't great. And Curse of Darkness just goes to show that when a 3D Castlevania game marches forth, it has problems. Sometimes scary problems. Like Lament of Innocence, it had so much potential to be good--this title more so. But it doesn't deliver, and that's a sad revelation to admit to, especially after having so much enjoyment with the DS smash: Dawn of Sorrow.Ever since the 1997 all time best, Symphony of the Night, so many main characters in the series have to be like Alucard in SOME way. Hector in Curse of Darkness is no exception. He looks a little like Alucard.But we're not here to discuss that. Hector is a Devil Forgemaster, one who has given up his powers. Dracula is dead, but the land is overun with the curse of monsters on the world of Valachia. Hector, however, isn't concerned about what kind of shape the world is in. He's more concerned about an evil Devil Forgemaster by the name of Issac, who has killed his beloved. If you couldn't guess, it's time for revenge. And so Issac leads Hector into a place full of traps and obstacles he must overcome. And by doing so, Hector will slowly recover his Devil Forgemaster skills and whatnot. The story actually unfolds with excellent voice-acting, but there isn't much story.Since Symphony of the Night we've been given this Metroid style exploration when it comes to Castlevania. This is marvelous, and once again, makes its way into the 3D world of Castlevania. You explore a large castle riddled with goodies. This includes weapons, subweapons, armour and much more.Playing the game can be quite fun. Most of the game, as you might have guessed, is spent running through endless hallways of defeating monsters. That isn't as boring as you might think. You can perform some cool looking combos on enemies, but each one must be finished with the B button. You can also lock onto enemies and perform combos. This makes the camera go crazy, though, but this is forgiveable. Battling without locking on is actually much better, and it isn't too hard to do without. Although, if you want to steal from your enemies, you'll have to lcok on to 'em. Speaking of stealing, it's nice that you can actually do that. Many a time a monster will leave himself open for stealing. This usually occurs while it recovers from taking damage. Again, you must be locked on for it to happen.Likewise, unlike Lament of Innocence, they actually use the level up system. In other words, there's actually a point to battling through hordes of monsters this time.You also have little helper monsters. You can compare them to the familiars found in other Castlevania games (like Symphony of the Night and Dawn of Sorror), but the better comparison would be Pokemon. They lend their assistance and gain experience from defeating enemies, just as you do. It's nice not to have to go at it alone, but we Castlevania veterans would prefer to go at it alone. Each enemy also drops evolution crystals. Collect enough of them and your monster will evolve. You won't grow to like them, though. That's the sad part, and they don't really enhance the game-play. The monsters have special abilities, though. Golem like creatures can open heavy doors, imps let you bury underground. But you can't help but admit it would be nice if your little innocent devils were actually characters. Also, no evolution crystal is the same. You can take advantage of the system by collecting different types of crystals and seeing how your little buddies evolve.One of the nice things about being a devil forger, you can make your own weapons! And Hector can do it at any time he wants! That's right, no running back to some stupid shop to do it! Monsters often drop raw materials, and you can use them to make new weapons or make your current weapons stronger. You can do this simply by opening the menu. I don't know about you, but that's pretty satisfying to me to be able to do that.The weapons have their own little downside however. With the exception of the sword, none of them are highly helpful in combat. You start the game off with a short sword, and you'll grow accustomed to its fast speed and easy use. Other weapons just aren't fast enough, and enemies aren't weak to a certain weapon "type". This makes the weapon crafting system a little useless at some points. Unless you're a person who likes to use "cool" looking weapons as opposed to swift and powerful weapons, you won't have THAT much use for the weapon crafting system, except to power up your sword. Thus, experimenting with weapons garners no fun.It is pretty cool, I must say, to be venturing somewhere that isn't Dracula's castle. Instead you actually venture through the world of Valachia. Meaning you'll trek through swamps, mountains, valleys and a lot more. So if you're tired of Dracula's castle, this is quite a change.The problem with this "world" is that you don't see enough of it. There's not enough detail to it. You have to follow a beaten path (so it isn't really that different than Dracula's castle in Lament of Innocence), so you can't go off and just explore the places you're at. The game also suffers from what Lament of Innocence suffered from: the lack of detailed enviroments. You'll no doubt run down the same path/hall/corridor several times over. If it weren't for the map you'd find yourself lost, thinking you must be in one of those "looping" ares, or that you took a wrong turn and ended up running in a circle.The monsters are also not so great. What I love about the 2D Castlevania games (especially in the new Dawn of Sorrow) is how much variety is thrown into the monsters. The attacks they use on you. Even if they're the same looking monster, they throw in some new attack that you don't expect. Curse of Darkness (like Lament of Innocence) has no variety. You'll run into the same batch of monsters constantly, and they'll never do something new. Later in the game you'll find yourself fighting nothing but reincarnates of different colored monsters that do nothing new. Likewise, all the monsters you'll ever see are encountered pretty early on. The moment you run into an Axe Armor, you've run into 'em all! They'll never change.I sound like I'm being picky about the enemies thing, but I'm not. It takes away from the challenge of the game. The fact that reincarnates don't do anything new makes it more true. And that's not the worst part: the game overall just isn't a challenge. The bosses can be, at times, but if you've been playing 3D action games, I think you'll find even the more challenging bosses to be no challenge at all. The early boss battles in the game are fairly easy. Later on, however, they get start to get hard, and that's when battling them actually becomes fun. Again, though, if you're an action/adventure pro, you'll probably beat most of them on your first try.I wish I could say the graphics are great. Hey, Hector looks great in combat. But the enviroments don't have enough detail. Too many of them are simple everyday enviroments we've been seeing for a long time now. Where's the detail? You know... like... maybe the leaves on a tree moving? We're at that point where there could be some kind of interation with the enviroment, instead of it seeming like we're running through a still-life painting. Visually, it doesn't look half bad. It's just that there could be so much more. The bosses look cool, and the framerate doesn't slow down at all, but there isn't enough variety, or detail.However, I must say this: the music sounds AWESEOME! As usual, the Castlevania games have some of the best music there is to be heard in gaming! Is it better than Symphony of the Night? No, it's not. It isn't better than Lament of Innocence either (which also had steller music), but it is still among the best you'll ever hear in a video game. Likewise, the voice acting is actually really really GOOD! I just wish I could've heard more of it!Curse of Darkness had the potential to be a good game. But there are a lot of things that keep it down. It's a fairly fun game to play, but it lacks innovation. You won't be able to separate it from the other action/adventure 3D games. It's got nothing that makes it stick out.If you MUST have this game, however, I'd say wait for a price drop. If you're really looking for a good Castlevania game, I'd suggest getting a hold of "Dawn of Sorrow". It's a much better game.The Good:+Great Music! Some of the best in gaming!+Good weapon system+It's pretty fun to play+You can steal from enemies!+Great Voice acting!The Bad-Little innovation-Lack of cutscenes to advance the story-Too much of the game gets recycled too fast-Too easy-The game doesn't look bad, but there's little imagination in the environments-Not a whole lot of different enemies-It's too easy-Boring level designs (not enough of them)-You just can't help that the game has almost no innovation! It's no different than your average action/adventure 3D gameGet Dawn of Sorrow, or one of the other 2D versions of the game. They seem to fare so much better than this one does. Even the die-hard fan of Castlevania has to admit this one is rather bland
+ Saw the movie, HAD to get the game! (I also have Project Zoo, that was good too.)Overall not bad, but then again we love Wallace and Gromit. Loved the fact a friend could join in at any time to help, but you have to stay close though. We found the camera engine was a tad of a pain - like with two players, the camera might get stuck in a wall, blocking your view - (tunnels could be a problem) but a quick fix we did was one player would exit play for a moment, that would reset the camera, then the other could rejoin. It was a challenge to beat the game at 100% but my sister and I did just that! Got a brain wedgie finding all the rabbits, but loved it just the same. Loved being free to roam about and explore - try reading the little signs scattered about on walls! They are cool! Will play it again. Addictive game, fun to boot. That from a thirty something - yes I still play video games! Some say all the weird ones.Thank you Nick Park for allowing the games! And making the movie
+ I enjoyed playing this game, when it would let me...the amount of bugs in this game is downright outrageous, crashes left and right.  It was a good story though.  I suppose I could give you a few tips...To stop the Dantooine framerate from dropping, go to the folder where your game files are ex. c:/program files/lucasarts/swkotor2, and open the swkotor2.ini file (on my xp the icon was a notepad with a cogwheel over it), and under the [Graphics Options] heading insert a line and type:Disable Vertex Buffer Objects=1That should get rid of any bad framerate drops on Dantooine and at least make it playable.Also, I had a glitch near the end of the game where I went back to Dantooine, but when I tried to get off my ship, the planet wouldn't load, I tried restarting and all that jazz, nothing worked, finnaly I found online a cheatcode to warp straight to Dantooine so to use it, open the swkotor2.ini file as I said above and under the [Game Options] header insert a line and type:EnableCheats=1Then Start StarWars:KOTOR2 and load your game, and press this button:` the one with the ~ sign right above it, just above the tab key.Then type:warp 605dan-Then Press Enter-Don't worry about the fact you can't see your typing, the cheat console is invisible. And Tada! Your on Dantooine and Can finish your game!The only other advice I have for you is !Save Often! and !Don't OverWrite Your Saved Games! I found that saving your games as 1,2,3,4,etc., to be a quick way to do this.May the Force be with You
+ Star Wars KOTOR 2 is a decent game overall and well worth playing if you like good RPG's. It starts off much stronger then the first game and has a very similar mid game. I felt that the end game was weaker when compared to the first but still very decent
+  IF YOU EVER PLAYED ANY KOTOR GAME U KNOW THAT ITS THE KING OF RPGs, AND I KNOW THAT U ALL WANT THE 3RD GAME TO COME OUT TO. BUT IT ISENT! THE GAME GOT CANCELLED AND A BUNCH OF GUYS ONLINE ARE TRYIN TO RESURECT THE KOTOR SERIES BY MAKING THIS PETITION. WE DONT HAVE NO WHERE NERE AS MUCH AS WE SHOULD, 'ROUND 3600, SO HELP US OUT AND GO TO petition online AND HELP US RESURECT THIS GREAT SERIES!!!
+ If you are about to switch to an Xbox 360, buy this game first as your last Xbox game, you won't be disappointed. This game has the best graphics I have ever seen on a console. Although it has great graphics, the physics are the real selling point. You can pick up virtually anything in the world and throw it around or stack it with the Gravity Gun (Zero-Point Energy Manipulator). Barrels float in the water like they should and explosions are suprisingly realistic. The enemies and challenging and varied and dead bodies flop around like they should (especially when you shoot them with the shotgun). The voice acting is very well done and characters will turn to look at you if you move around. The only drawback is choppy framerates at times. Highly recommended
+ I just finished HL2 on the Xbox and thought some of my observations might be helpful to other prospective buyers. My review is primarily concerned with my struggle between getting HL2 for PC or Xbox. I bought HL, HL Opposing Force and HL Blue Shift for the PC when they came out and thoroughly enjoyed them. Due to the HL2 Xbox price and the horror stories I'd read about having to be online to use the PC version of HL2, I decided to go for the Xbox version. Did I make the right choice?HL2 is a very good game and at $20 for the Xbox version, represents excellent value for money. Great graphics, great sound and engaging game play. However, I think HL1 on the PC is a better game than HL2 on Xbox. Why? First, the original HL was much more open ended and there was often more than one way to do something or get somewhere. With HL2, I found there was only one way. Second, the controls for HL1 were better and configurable. With HL2 on Xbox, I found some controls to be really awkward and difficult to use. For example, there's an air boat to drive and the direction and throttle are on the same thumb stick. I assume throttle and direction are separate keys on the PC version? Third, when there's a lot going on, for example, several Combine soldiers firing at you, explosions and a fair bit of scenery to display, the Xbox slowed down to almost a halt! It just couldn't cope with that amount of processing. I never had that problem with HL1 on the PC and assume a suitably equipped PC could cope with HL2 just as well. Lastly, as others have mentioned you didn't have to go very far in HL2 before you saw a `loading' screen. The frequency at which you saw this did become distracting and annoying after a while. One plus for HL2 is there's no weird psychedelic alternative dimension like there was in HL1. Remember all that hopping from floating platform to floating platform and plants that light up when you went near them? All that nonsense has gone away which was a relief!On reflection, most of my gripes about HL2 have more to do with the Xbox version rather than the game itself. If I had to choose again, I'd buy HL2 on the PC and will certainly get any HL2 spin off games for the PC if they are to appear like they did for HL1. If not, I'll wait for HL3 which the ending of HL2 leaves open. 
+ Half-Life 2 for pc put on the x-box sounds like it should work.  The core game-play is still the same and is good fun once you get a few hours into it. The graphics are decent but won't blow you away like the pc versian. So what's the problem it's Half-life 2 on the x-box just a little watered down. Well there is one single problem that really irritates me to the point I would give it three stars. L.O.A.D.I.N.G!!!! This game loads more than you actually play it. It simply ruins the action! Your in the middle of a tense adrenaline pumped chase and your really into it when it all suddenly stops and the game loads. The loading times last between seven to thirty seconds and it really just makes you want to swear at the t.v. screen. Half-life 2 for x-box isn't bad game but it is completley inferior to the p.c. problem which had loading problems as well. It's possibly worth a rental if can sit through all the constant loading but beyond the loading issue it's worth a playthrough. There is no multi-player and the single player is all your getting so don't buy.
+ As always, the Nancy Drew games do not disappoint.  Personally, I quite enjoyed driving around delivering telegrams, if for no other reason than to keep my cash flow going, and to tour the rest of the town.  I must admit, I was a bit confused as to why HerInteractive wouldn't have incorporated the Courthouse into the game for some purpose, but hey, it's nice to see they have a penchant for detail.  After all, what town doesn't have a Courthouse? heh.Indeed, this game could have been designed to be twice as enduring (and there were several ways this could have been accomplished), but to be honest, enduring does not equate with endearing.  Every ND game has satisfied me on many levels, even if a few levels were left wanting.I also enjoyed going back in time to 1930, albeit there were a few inconsistencies regarding what took place when, I.e., the turntable revolving the wrong way, et al. ...however, a good detective will notice these faux pas.Like I say, there's rarely any disappointment when it comes to the Nancy Drew games.  One can only hope they continue to create these games indefintely.  My only gripe is that they come out with only two games a year.  My wish would be for four or five. :
+ I love playing this game.  The Icewind Dale II is 3rd edition rules and the graphics are great
- DVD's which play perfectly well on other cheap players, freeze/skip or don't play when I try to play them on the XBOX. Don't waste your money on this, buy a stand-alone DVD player instead so you won't have the frustration that I've had
+ The reviewer below must have some other conflict with the game, because I am currently running a game of IWD1 with Windows XP as I make this post
+ This game is great for those that enjoy role playing games.  There is a lot of reading involved but it adds to the story.It was a lot of fu
- This remote is of awful quality; I've been through two of them in the past year. I wouldn't complain so much if it didn't cost $30! It's worth ten, at most. Most people would be better off buying a cheap DVD player, rather than using the xbox
- I love the Nancy Drew games, and I own every one.  I bought this game, with high hopes--then I finished it in only one day.  It was that simple.  Yes, like all Nancy Drew games there were interesting characters, amazing graphics, and intriguing puzzles, but those good things failed to even out the bad.  The game was over much too quickly.  The problem of the game was too simple and seemingly unimportant.  There was not much to do, and the three or so mandatory tasks were monotonous and dull.  While the character-switch Her Interactive offered was interesting, it could also be very confusing.  The characters, though interesting, were not as thoroughly developed as in the other Nancy Drew games.  And what I consider the worst fault of all, the ending of the game was absolutely horrid.  It was by far the worst of all the games in its series.  There was no action, or chase, or anything that really needed a brain or quick thinking.  It was just over.  While the Nancy Drew games are an amazing series as a whole, this game just left me wondering, "What was Her Interactive thinking?"  I would recommend this game only to the die-hard Nancy Drew fans.  To those of you merely seeking a fun and entertaining game, look at some of the other Nancy Drew games.  I believe that "The Curse of Blackmoor Manor", "The Secret of Shadow Ranch", and "The Secret of the Scarlet Hand" are the best
- The game seemed to start off like any other Nancy Drew game.  My daughter has played them all.  However, after a while, it seemed as thow it was an easter egg hunt for three year olds.  Everything was easy to find and not mysterious at all.  All the other games took my daughter quite some time before she figured out the mystery.  However, this game took her two days.  All the other Nancy Drew games kept her intrigued and kept her coming back for more.  This game breezed by and and she was quite disappointed.  In fact, her words at the end of the game were, "that's it?".  Her interactive, better come out with a more interesting game next time or you'll lose the interest
+ Ignore anyone who talks about this game's "shortcomings."  It's a fun game, addictive game.  Period.   Although one reviewer suggests that some of the levels are too easy, I say that this only goes to keep the game (and the plot) moving.  In fact, let's face it, when you break the tasks down, events in a typical episode of 24 aren't that complex.  You run, you hide, you shoot things.  You drive fast and chase people.  But you do it all, looking, sounding, and panting (yes, the video Jack Bauer even breathes like him) almost as if you were in the show.  The KISS adage is fabulously apt.  Keeping it simple is how the game-makers have kept it fun. Related to this is the comment about trying to make the actual game play last 24 hours.  Firstly, the show itself is a little loosy-goosey about real "hour" what with commercial breaks and its creative liberties.  Secondly, each "hour" is broken up into smaller missions, and learning what it takes to do well in each section can take little time.  Thirdly, those that choose to complete their missions with finesse (and higher scores) will find that they're not only coming closer the "hour," they're also having more fun, because they're acting more like the characters in the show.  After all, I suppose that someone who wants to complete their missions quickly could just avoid shooting anyone, and instead just run past the enemies!  Or better yet, if that reviewer really wants to take the "24 hour" thing seriously, I'm surprised that he isn't complaining about being able to save progress to a memory card.  He really ought to be asking for a game that's played straight out for an entire 24 hours, no saving, get it right the first time, just like on the show. 
- Seems like they just huried this game. Too much running around to get answers. The phone did not even have web acsess. Actually I did not like it at all
- My daughter and I have played all of the previous games; we've enjoyed them overall.  Some of the games are fantastic, challenging and fun. This game was quite lame in comparison to the others.  The puzzles weren't really puzzling, just boring tasks.  There were not many clues to find.  Because there weren't many clues, there was no real sense of detecting anything.  The game ended abruptly and was very short.  We did NOT use a walk-through to solve the mystery in record time, just experienced a lack of challenge.  We did like the newness of becoming Frank and Joe Hardy occasionally.  The rest was pretty boring.  If you are looking for a Nancy Drew game, try one of the others instead
+ Like 90% of the people who played this game, my primary motivation for playing through was to watch a mini season of 24. The story takes place during the considerable gap of time between the 2nd and 3rd seasons of the show. With the actors from the show voicing their characters and the music and script written by the guys who work on the real show, it should not have been too hard to please me with this game. And in that respect, the game fulfilled, but did not exceed, my expectations. While I enjoyed watching this extra "day", the game-play left a lot to be desired. There was quite a bit of variety, which was nice, and you get to play as almost every character from the show. There were so many different types of missions that the standard "get from point A to point B while shooting people" missions only made up about 60% of the game. The rest of the game involved driving, computer hacking, interrogating, sniping, and such. This would be really cool if all these missions were actually fun. Pretty much any mission involving driving sucked, since the controls were incredibly sloppy. Interrogation was kind of fun the first time, but it didn't need to be done several times. There were three or four different computer hacking missions that got done over and over again, so that they weren't much fun by the end of the game. As for the rest of the game, I'd describe it as mediocre. There wasn't anything spectacular about the game-play; there were too many missions where the environment was so dark that it was impossible to see where I was going; and there was no reason at all for there to be two missions that involved shooting down a helicopter. In addition, there were too many missions that were unnecessarily difficult, in my opinion. In one such mission, you are playing as Jack and you have to defend a girl who is defusing a bomb. There is basically an endless supply of terrorists who keep rushing out and start shooting at you, and if the girl takes any damage at all she starts whining and stops working. It wouldn't be nearly so annoying if it weren't for the fact that there doesn't seem to be any strategy whatsoever to beating the mission. I must have made a dozen attempts with varying degrees of success. I have no idea what I did differently when I finally beat it. Pretty much any mission that involves you protecting another person is extremely annoying, because that person will usually tend to stand out in the open taking damage instead of finding cover. And despite the fact that your partner is firing their weapon constantly, they never hit a single enemy, so you have to take everyone out yourself.In all, the game is worth playing through for the story if you're a fan of the show. Otherwise, you could find much better action games out there
- The review by Bovey is spot-on!  These games have gotten more boring as they go.  The majority of this game is spent looking for the same shells over and over to make the same necklaces over and over....how much is enough?  There was no real sense of scariness or danger... just boredom! And the game was so short... suddenly it ended!  I am so disappointed in what these games have become.  I loved The Final Scene, I even liked Blackmoor Manor even though I could never have finished it without consulting a walkthrough.  This game was just lame. I don't recommend paying full price for it
+ So you're looking for an NBA game but don't know which one to get? I shall sort through the good and bad offered in both NBA Live 2006 and NBA 2K6.Between the two I have played (Live '06 and 2K6), I can honestly say NBA 2K6 was a better buy for me. At $20 I've had countless hours of some of the most joyous moments and some of the most frustrating. However, NBA 2K6 is more of an all-around basketball game. If you're good at offense and poor on defence chances are good that you won't win as many games as you might think. But if you're only good at defence and horrible at offense, you won't win much then either. You basically have to play an even game altogether (this is based on All-Star level).For fans of offensive-minded games, look no further than NBA Live 2006. The basic controls are straight-forward and easy to get a hang of so there won't be any real problems for newcomers to the series (such as myself). The best aspect featured in Live '06 is undoubtedly the Freestyle Superstars. My favourite team is the 76ers and to see Allen Iverson pulling off the moves he does in real life on a game is nothing short of a rush. Another highlight is that when you're left wide open for a shot, chances are extremely good that you'll drain it. Whereas on 2K6, you still basically had to have a perfect release.As for the overall look of each game, I'd say that NBA 2K6 steals that as well. When you're looking at Allen Iverson (or any other player for that matter) there's no question who you're looking at. He's got his tattoos, his cornrows, mustache, everything. NBA Live 2006, on the other hand, almost tends to look childish at times. Don't get me wrong, the graphics and dunks are awesome to look at, but as you're dribbling upcourt I can't help but think the player's arms are too long. Of course, that could just be me. 2K6 also seems to have more realistic courts (I could do without the shots of the fans though).NBA 2K6 pros:-Fantastic game-play-The more you play the more you learn, making it a game you can invest time in-The graphics are great-When you turn up the difficulty it ACTUALLY GETS HARDERNBA 2K6 cons:-Offseason on Legacy mode is kind of lame-Too frustrating at times-When the other team is on a run, it's nearly impossible to hit anything other than a lay-up-Loading time is almost ridiculousNBA Live 2006 pros:-Easy for anyone to pick up and play-Freestyle Superstars-Commentary is a lot better than 2K6-Dunks are fairly easy to execute and make for some excellent highlightsNBA Live 2006 cons:-Camera angle is horrible-Far too offensive-minded-Almost too easy at times-Fouls are called too liberally on youSo there you have it, a fairly unbiased view on each game. If Live '06 were to drop down to $20 I'd highly recommend it, because in reality, it really is fun to play. But at $30 I'm not sure if it's worth every penny. Plus, 2K6 has a great street ball mode in addition to the legacy mode, so did Live 06 ever really have a chance
+ You know what?  I absolutely hate it when people say that this game was hard.  I beat it on normal in one week! And this was when it first came out, when I was about twelve years old our around there maybe thirteen.  But, anyway this game was so fun! I got it the week it came out and that Christmas vacation, me and my brothers were glued to the computer playing that game, or at least watching me play it.  I have beaten that game five times now and it never gets old
- I've been a fan of these games since the first one - Secrets Can Kill - came out.  I've played them all.I'm not at all sure what's happened to the games, though.  While the graphics have steadily improved, the puzzles, plot, and game-play have really gone downhill.  The first game, "Secrets Can Kill" had pretty horrific graphics, but the story was compelling and there were some fabulous puzzles in it.  Things really picked up with the second game, "Stay Tuned for Danger".  Better graphics and a very interesting story, very cool puzzles, great plot.  I can absolutely recommend Games 2 (Stay Tuned for Danger), 3 (Message in a Haunted Mansion), 4 (Treasure in the Royal Tower), 5 (The Final Scene), 6 (Secret of the Scarlet Hand), 7 (Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake), 9 (Danger on Deception Island), and 10 (Secret of Shadow Ranch).These games are similar in length and have interesting puzzles.  Lots of areas where you can snoop around - which I really enjoy.  Game #8 (The Haunted Carousel) is interesting and has wonderful graphics, but is awfully short.  I did not at all enjoy #11 (Curse of Blackmoor Manor) as I found it way too difficult.   I also cannot really recommend #12 (Secret of the Old Clock). It was too short and repetitive.  I did somewhat enjoy #13 (Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon) and #14 (Danger by Design) but they were nowhere near the quality of the earlier games in terms of plot or puzzles.And now, we have #15.  Outstanding graphics, but way too short.  The amount of repetition of puzzles in order to advance drove me completely crazy.  I don't mind Nancy running about doing errands to help people (for that, I thought Games 3 and 4 had it perfectly balanced).  But I like each task to be different and interesting.  Not mind-numbingly repetitive and boring.  This seems to be a factor of the more recent games - delivering telegrams in Game #12, painting pictures in Game #14, and now finding seashells and making necklaces in this game.  I miss looking for clues.  Putting together evidence for a purpose.  I miss puzzles that actually are woven into the fabric of the plot and are there to advance the game.  It seems like the repetition now might be so that it can be said that this game took X number of hours to complete.  I also miss learning useful things.In #1, I learned about American Sign LanguageIn #3, I learned about Chinese symbols and the San Francisco earthquakeIn #4, I learned about latitude and longitude and how a sextant worksIn #6, I learned SO much about the Maya and how to work a HAM radioIn #7, I learned about Roman Numerals and ProhibitionIn #8, I learned how to make invisible writing!In #9, I learned how to work a HAM radio and about Pacific Northwest sea animalsAfter that, well, I didn't really learn very much of anything useful in any of the later games.  If you've never played a Nancy Drew game, please, please, PLEASE do yourself a favor and start with one of the earlier games (although probably not the very first one - the graphics aren't as good and switching discs can be highly annoying).  But give #2 - 9 a try; you won't be disappointed!Oh please, Her Interactive, PLEASE go back to the way they used to be structured.  I'd gladly sacrifice some of the improved graphics if it meant regaining some plot, cohesion, or integrated, interesting puzzles.
+ ...and three years later I buy the game.Wow! Awesome! I can't believe it runs so well after the three years of its release! Everything looks and feels great on my XP. This is one of the only games I have purchased and and not had to return due to the CD being messed up or some corrupted file. So... I'm happy!I thought no one would play the multi player anymore but there seem to always be games going on. Yep, this is a game I would suggest to any gamer
- this game has a 25 minute introduction or story.  Square Enix was really creative and the stories are so good!  However I do expect them to put something like "Skip Intro" cause impatient people could really get mad at the stories!  I, however only get a game every five months so I am fine with that.  This is only a minor flaw.  Another flaw is that when you want to look at the map or statistics, you have to wait 5 seconds until it appears.  Very annoying, but again a minor flaw.  This game depends on how much you like to battle the same creatures over and over and over again!  It get very boring after awhile.  You have to train those dumb spirits and sometimes you just want them to level up quicker.  This game gets very boring after awhile and you will want to ditch the game as well as the characters.  There is not much action and you have a limited amount of monsters to battle.  1.0 ~ 3.5----- terrible3.6 ~ 5-----bad5.1 ~ 6.5-----average6.6 ~ 8-------good8.1 ~ 9------great9.1 ~10------must buy excellent!                    graphics- 9/10  great                    sound   -9/10   some voice acting but great                    fun   -   5/10  depends on how patient you are and how you react to battling the same monster over and over again                                   average- about 8                                  my grade-   7   goo
- I had read pretty good reviews about this game so I bought it.   I was hoping for something with a little action with an interesting storyline.  What I got was probably the most boring game I have ever played.- The introduction/prolouge lasts about 7 minutes or so, including the credits.  You cannot break out and move on- After you set down your PSP and grab a drink, you come back and find that there is one short battle for you to play.  Then you go back to the "story".  The characters have long, annoying conversations and you get to press "X" at the end of each of their sentances.  Again, no way to break out, no in-game menu for you to manage the game.  You have to go through each painfully slow dialog box until the "chapter" is over.This game is really bad.  Maybe it gets a little more interesting; it is possible that there is actually something for you to do besides watch the characters argue.  It is really slow and it is all about the storyline and the dialog.  There does not appear to be any freeplay.  If you have played this type of game before and you enjoy that style of play, then you might like it.  I was bored and frustrated from the first minute
- Pretty much sums up how I felt after 15 minutes of introductory waffle, hellishly annoying bingy bongy music and (admittedly very pretty) cut scenes, totally emotionless voice overs, impossibly slow conversations that served little or no point.And to be honest at that point it was either switch off the psp or throw it against a wall. I decided to switch it off. Now I'm a big fan of adventure games, played untold legends 1 till it gave up on me (literally left hanging around with nothing to do and no more quests on offer). From what I can gather, the in game graphics for Valkyrie (after 15 minutes [though it seemed like much longer]) I'd seen some really cool character graphics - bit like tekken DR in-game graphics - and some of those horrible 2d munchkin japanese rpg graphics, which are the in-game stuff.So the bit you play looks like it's 20 years old and should be on a gba, the cutscenes are nice but there will no doubt be far too many of those - ie: 5 minutes of slow cut scenes for every encounter.I can't say this is a proper review as I couldn't stand this title long enough to get to any actual game-play and there's no way I'm sitting through that intro again.My advice, if you like the long winded old style walk-and-talk for three hours before actually doing anything, japanese rpgs. Get this (or better still go to an antiques shop and find an old text adventure). If you prefer a game where you actually play the character and do stuff - avoid this like the plague.I've got high hopes for dungeon siege when it comes out (but then I had high hopes for valkyrie too :-( ), but for now untold legends 2 is okay, not as good as it should have been but a helluva lot more fun than valkyrie. I would like to point out that I've never played on a ps2, xbox or game cube - so this is the first time I've seen a valkyrie profile game. I didn't have any preconceptions, obviously if I had I'd never have gone anywhere near this title in the first place :-)
+ The Xbox DVD Movie Playback Kit is very easy to set up and use. All you have to do is plug the little receiver into one of the controller ports, put in a DVD and enjoy. The buttons on the remote are responsive and easy to get used to. However, the Xbox DVD system is very simple. It doesn't have any eject buttons (something mentioned many times by other reviewers) and not as many options as more expensive stand-alone DVD players. You have to keep in mind that it was made for people who already have an Xbox and don't want to shell out an extra $50 for a DVD player that has a lot of special features when all they want is to be able to watch a movie. The DVD itself runs exactly as it would on a good stand-alone DVD player. It's sort of like one of those little $100 digital cameras. There isn't anything really special about them. They just take good pictures that you can put on your computer.
+ Purchase the xbox console and DVD movie playback kit that matches the region in which you are located.After you buy the DVD kit and put the DVD infrared sensor into your xbox,the DVD kit permanently codes your xbox based on the region that your kit is from(the region code of the DVD kit is  only written on the outside packaging of the kit).From that point forward,you can only play DVD's from the region that the xbox DVD kit is from and,ofcourse,DVD's carrying the label 'all regions'.You cannot play DVD's from another region even if you later on try using a DVD kit from that other region on your xbox.For instance,if you are in the US and have a region 1 DVD kit and you import a DVD from abroad,say, having region code 3,it will not play on your xbox console.But here's how you can change the DVD region on your xbox to play it.1-Send your xbox console for a repair to have it re-adjusted to play DVD's from the desired region.You will have to pay for a repair here even if your xbox is still in warranty period.2-Next,buy a DVD kit sold for the desired region to use after your xbox console is repaired.From here on in,you can only play DVD's from this region and ,ofcourse,DVD's carrying the label 'all regions'.It is is a permanent change.Thus your xbox console acts like a 'region specific' DVD player rather than a 'region free' DVD player.But all said, I have no problems with the DVD kit.I have a sony DVD player but I find the picture clarity better on xbox.(all the above info was procured from xbox customer care department.To this end,I hold that it is correct )
+ Star Wars: Jedi Knight II - Jedi Outcast. The third game in the Star Wars Dark Forces series.INTRODUCTION:I've pretty much always been a fan of Star Wars, and as you may have guessed, I'm a fan of many of the games based on the series. Although Star Wars games are often hit and miss, when one succeeds, it usually succeeds beautifully. One of the most interesting ideas for a Star Wars game was Dark Forces, released for the Playstation One and the PC. Although the game itself was horrendous, with a terribly-choppy framerate and very poor level design, it was something the world had never seen before - a Star Wars first-person shooter. The sequel, Jedi Knight, cleaned up a lot of the problems, and added in some new innovations. And now the third game in the series, Jedi Outcast, has arrived. Like previous games in this sub-series, it has gotten a multi-console release. Read on to see how it fares!OVERVIEW:Jedi Outcast is a Star Wars first-person shooter. The game has a one-player quest, as well as several different multi-player modes. REVIEW:To put it simply, this game is everything the original Dark Forces should have been. While not perfect, this game is a huge improvement over its predecessors. Once again you play the role of Kyle Katarn, the agent from the other Dark Forces titles. The second Death Star has been destroyed, but many Imperial forces still fight on, so it's up to you to infiltrate their hideouts and exterminate them. The graphics are, for the most part, solid. I was impressed at how good they are for this kind of game. Nothing state-of-the-art, but they're still pretty damn good. Control has also been given an overhaul and rightfully so, since this game lets you use force powers and wield a lightsaber. The single-player mode is extremely entertaining, and the fact that the game offers multi-player options only adds to the overall value of the package. And you can save whenever you want to in the single-player mode! But, of course, the game isn't perfect. Like earlier Dark Forces games, the level design just is not that good. Too many areas look alike, and there are too many instant death spots that are just too easy to fall into. Likewise, in many cases your objectives are unclear, and some of the puzzles are a pain - I don't know about you, but I buy first-person shooters to shoot people, not solve puzzles! Because of the imbalanced puzzles and often poor level design, it took me over an hour just to beat the first level! Another huge problem is availability. Lack of custom control configuration also plagues the game. This is a huge problem, since the game's limited control selections will often clash with what you're used to for this sort of game. This game wasn't released on the consoles in very high quanitites, so you're likely gonna have to shell out the full new price just to get a USED copy - and in my mind, it's NOT worth that price. Sad but true. I do recommend this game to Star Wars fans, just be warned that it's not perfect, and it's hard to get a copy.EDITION NOTES:This is a good game, but for some strange reason it just wasn't available on the consoles for very long. Because of this, even USED copies fetch close to the original new retail price. This is extremely annoying for people like me who want to get every Star Wars game. Still, you should hunt it down if you're into this sort of thing.OVERALL:Overall this is the best game in the Dark Forces sub-series thusfar. Where the game succeeds, it succeeds beautifully. I am impressed with the game, it's just a shame the consular version was not made readily available to all would-be players. I strongly recommend this game if you can get a hold of it - I doubt it will disappoint any Star Wars fan
+ This game is fun best lightsaber combat ever but it is hard at time's but when you get all your force power's it is SO F***ING FUN you can cut everybody's arm's off just like in the frist star wars movie cool man just cool
+ Early on in the game you use a pistol and rifle and take down some stormtroopers for the New Republic as you explore their base, with no force powers. But events make a turn for the worse and you go to Luke and request for your lightsaber back. Then you begin to discover force powers as you search out the dark Jedi/killer of your girlfriend for the rest of the game. With amazing graphics and increddible duels, this game is simply magnificent. Plus the multi-player is awesome (especially when you play CTF and give the other team a boat load of Storm Troopers you and your friend being rebels with one bot helping you against twenty or so Stormtroopers makes the game a game you'll never want to trade in! Plus the duels are fun to play again and again. I would have five stars but the game does have two or three puzzles that are quite difficult.  All in all a great game that any StarWars fan must own, any shooter fan really has to have, and if you like both, oooh you need it really bad
+ ...but the game was too simple and too short.  I do like Creature of Kapu Cave better than Danger by Design.  While I appreciate the quality of graphics, sound effects, and music, it seems like the producers of the Nancy Drew games have changed hands in recent years.  We're seeing a stark difference in the newer games compared to their past games such as: Shadow Ranch, Danger on Deception Island, Treasure in Royal Tower, etc.  (Those games are fantastic!)  With the recent games, play is not as fluid, the tasks are too simple-minded, there's not much mystery or suspense (if any), and game play time is too short.In 'Creature', you can collect shells and make necklaces and you can go fishing - for as long as you want to!  Or until you get bored with it.  The beach and water graphics are cool.  There is some humor with some the character conversations.  I enjoyed that.  You get to move between four locations that intertwine and make sense.  I didn't see any problem with the auto-switching (via cell phone calls) between Nancy and the Hardy Boys.  That was not a problem for me.  I almost rated this a 3 star, but gave it 4 due to the graphics, characters, and variety of locations.Hopefully, Her Interactive will hear their customers disappointments and revamp upcoming games.  Fans do want the Nancy Drew games to keep coming
- I love the idea behind this game and it's pretty impressively exectuted. I had three gripes though: 1) It's so fast paced that I found it really difficult to progress past the third procedure. 2)I couldn't get the magnify and reduce (with quick little circles) to work.  This caused me great frustration. 3)There's no way to skip through the seemingly endless pages of character dialogue if you have to repeat a procedure a couple of times.I quit playing it pretty quickly
+ The introduction ISN'T boring, it ISN'T long, and it IS one of the best introductions to a game made by Enix/SE.  If you don't like the omg 25 min to wste on into2111!!!1, then don't buy another RPG for as long as you live.  RPGs are supposed to have stories, and this one is no different.  If you don't like it, take it back and get a refund... don't play RPG's like this if you can't stand words.  Go play some GTA or something--- oh wait, theres words in that too
+ Valkyrie Profile was an RPG that came out during the later days of the PSX.  While it never achieved massive success, it went on to become an RPG classic and has garnered a very loyal following.Fast forward to 2006, and we see the re-release of this awesome RPG for the PSP.  However, don't make the mistake of writing this off as a plain old port.  Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth includes "new" high quality CG movies that help immerse you in the story.  The graphics consist of highly detailed sprites on pre-rendered backgrounds; when seen on the vivid PSP screen, it just makes the game look downright beautiful.  Some of the combos are just awesome to look at. The battle system is a mix of real-time and turn-based fighting that is surprisingly intuitive; newcomers and old pro's will have no problem getting used to it.  At first glance, it might look simple, but as you progress through the game, you'll find a depth to it that makes it quite fun.The main story, itself, is very well developed...even if this RPG doesn't follow the traditional linear way of telling it.  One of the things I enjoyed most about this game is the character "episodes" you see when you collect a new soul to help in the battle to save Valhalla.  If you enjoy RPGs, or feel adventurous enough...I highly recommend you buy this game.  It's definitely a must have PSP game. 
+ Great remake, but where's the fast forward! My kingdom for a fast forward button!This was a great game! The cut scenes were a nice touch that helped draw in the player into the story line, but would someone please give me a Fast Forward/Skip button. I understand that the makers of the game want you to get involved and appreciate the storyline, but without a fastforward/skip button, this game game has a limited replay value. I have already played through the game once, and now that I am running through it again, I am going insane! The long cut scenes, and the seemingly endless, "next" clicks were fine the first time, but come on! For a game that has 3 different endings you would figure that the developers would give you a break!OK, now that I have said that, lets get back to the review. The character development and use of magical items, while definitely not unique, but they helped flesh out the fight scenes. The combos and skills moves made the game interesting and kept me coming back. While I would have liked to see the graphics slightly change when different equipment was used (swords, helms, etc) the combat and special moves graphics were definitely nice.Should you buy? Sure if you like RPG's the game is definitely a buy, but be fore warned...be prepared to read, and read, and read, and click and click and click, before you even get to your first fight scene, and even then expect to much of the same long before you get to do things on your own
-  This game is mindnumbingly hard not because its a very challenging but rather its set up to fail.Most missions thrust you into a situation with little indication of what to do. As the patients vital signs drops, you frantically poke at your DS trying to think on what to do. The nurse, who assists you, gives you vague ideas on how and before you know it you've failed the mission. It would take me an average of 10-15 failures before I finally won a mission. The last mission I played that made me quit, resulted in 30+ failures. And that's only being 1 hour and half into the game. The graphics are crisp and clear. The storyline didn't make much of an impression on me. But I was probably too frustrated to pay attention to that. This game had a lot of potiental but killed it by constantly making you fail. Do not buy this game unless you have an extreme amount of patients, game collector who will keep it sealed, or you're a gultton for punishment. Whatever you do, do not buy this game for the hype. It does not live up to it. 
- I know that Pelican screen protectors and styluses are tempting because they're always the cheapest ones available.  That should tell you something.First of all, the top screen uses adhesive.  It's smooth plastic in the middle, but the edges will leave sticky goo on the screen.  Because the edge is a different material than the middle, it's insanely difficult to squeeze the air bubbles out of it, and being adhesive, trying again and again isn't much of an option.  Furthermore, the sticky edge is white, not clear, and it looks horrible on my onyx DS Lite.After having so much difficulty with the top screen protector, I checked online for reviews.  I read several reports of people who used the Pelican styluses with the Pelican bottom screen protector and the screen protector being very drastically scratched up within an hour's worth of use.  So, whether the stylus is too harsh for the bottom screen protector or the screen protector was too flimsy for the stylus, the combination just doesn't work.Many people report simply throwing their Pelican Write and Protect sets into the trash, so I'm not the only one that paid Pelican money for something that's going into the trash can.  No matter how inexpensive Pelican's product is, it's still too expensive if you end up throwing it in the trash too.I know I'm going to avoid the Pelican screen protectors and styluses in the future, and I very much wish that there were reviews here on Amazon before I bought mine.  I had to dig through Nintendo DS forums to read other peoples' opinions.Finally, if you already bought one and hate it, you can remove it by using scotch tape on the edges to peel it off and rubbing alcohol to remove the residue
- To me, this game was seriously disappointing. So disappointing, I didn't finish the second case before setting it down forever. I was highly entertained - at first. It's cute, funny, and going around clicking on things for a new DS user was highly entertaining. However, it quickly got older. 1. You can't skip through the horrendously long dialog - ever. Even after you've heard it about a million times because you're clicking on people hopelessly in frustration unable to figure out what to do.2. I found myself looking for an internet walk through, yes, on this simplistic game. I couldn't figure out what to click and wandering around hopelessly for thirty minutes reading over dialog you've read a thousand times just gets too frustrating even for my typical patience level.3. Possible Spolier - There seemed to be a glich in the second story in which I talked to the wrong person at the wrong time and then I could never get a ticket into the planetarium. After that, I just couldn't take it any more and gave up.4. The places and people never change. For each case, from my understanding, it's all the exact same tiny few places. I'm not a big gamer, but I like a world bigger than three feet. I let a friend borrow it and thus far she is enjoying it more than me. Just to help this review - I'm a college-age female and this is my first gaming console, although I've played the PS2 quite a bit. Maybe it's really a hit or miss but I don't really recommend it for anyone but someone with a high patience level. A REALLY high patience level
+ Yeah this game is really fun, just gets extremely hard at times towards the end. Have a little over 10 hours into it, kind of short I guess, but each mission might take you a few tries to complete. Plus the fact you might spend 30 tries on some like I did. I'd say it's easily one of the best games out for the DS though. One that everyone should have in their DS collection.
+ This game is so creative.  It's really atypical and really exciting
- This GameCube is WEAK. I have owned both the NES and the Nintendo 64 and those were excellent gaming systems. Nintendo's recent system, the GameCube, has several problems with it's design. First of all, the internal fan is slow but, quiet. After an hour or so of use, the system overheats, thus shuts down. Second problem, the wireless controllers for this system SUCK. We have tried 4 brands and none have worked more than a week. The brands we have tried: Pelican, Intec, Nintendo, and Osmart. The third problem is that the system was not built to last. I still have the NES and Nintendo 64, which both work great! I doubt the GameCube will last past 4-5 years of use. Simply put, DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! ALSO! The Nintendo Wii is going to come out soon. From the description and from the specs, you will need to stand up and interact (move around and stuff) with the game. Sounds fun but, would you like to do that after a hard day of work? It will work something like the Sony Eye Toy.
- This game is fun and injoyable, but the bonus levels are questionable and it is almost better with less people
+ One of the main reasons that I decided to become a GameCube owner was due to its ability to play GBA, GBC, and GB games on an external source, a television, a projector, a 5" universal screen, etc. I could care less about its inability to play DVDs because I had already owned a PlayStation 2 for that. Then afterwards, I started using less for Game Boy titles and more for a game called Super Smash Bros Melee, which most of my former floormates used to play almost all of the time and I would just stand there and watch.The system itself is cube-shaped, hence the name GameCube. Like the original Xbox, it comes with four controller sockets and the controller is similar in appearance, but smaller (and no, it is not better than the PS2 controller). Like the PlayStation 2, it uses memory cards to store data. Unique to the GameCube is a handle on the back of the unit, making it easier to carry. Furthermore, it can be purchased in a variety of colors: platinum, black, and purple. Other colors can be imported, though I would recommend finding a store that does paint jobs. I'm giving this an 8.3/10, but that's only because as a North American, I can't help but feel somewhat cheated. For whatever reason, when it comes to video games and their machines, the US dwellers are always deprived of really neat things, like Panasonic Qs (GameCubes with built-in DVD players), GameCube/Game Boy player bundle deals, PlayStation Xs, NES Axe Colors, Tri-star adapters, Game Boy hunters, the availability of systems in multiple colors, etc. Interestingly enough, I've found this problem to be prevalent with mostly the Nintendo and Sony systems. (Whoever said life isn't fair sure wasn't joking.) If the Panasonic Q had ever been released in the US and if this system had at lest been available in more colors here (without having to import - an unnecessarily tedious, complicated and excessively costly procedure, by the way), then this probably could have gotten something closer to the 5-star range, but with all due respect, one would think that Nintendo would start showing a little more consideration and respect for us Americans than that.The KAB score: 8.3 super.
+ My son has had many happy hours with this game.  It came extremely quickly and all transactions were very easy
+ My husband just bought this for my five year old daughter (preschool graduation gift:)). She hasn't been able to leave it alone. Now, she's a little more advanced in the world of gaming than some her age, and definitely better than me, her mom - so I can't recommend it for every kid - but if your kid is adept at x-box - they should enjoy this one. It doesn't hurt that she loves the movie as well
+ We bought this for my 6 y/o daughter to go with the X-Box we bought for Christmas.  We have not owned a game system except for a game-boy since the original Nintendo came out.  This game has been fun for us all. We all play at the same time, which makes for some family fun. My daughter is able to play some alone without getting too frustrated and does well when we all play.  Personally I enjoy the comedic elements that have been well thought out.  If you are a hard core gamer you will probably get bored of it quickly.  It may not be as challenging as you like.  We have gotten over half way through without a cheat book, which is amazing for most games.  
- This is Supposed to be an x-box cleaner, but the system does not read the disc.  A shoddy product
- I am a huge fan of the RPG genre and have played just about every one for the PC.  Morrowind is the most boring one I have ever played.  I turned it off after two evenings of SLOWLY walking around, having stupid repetitive conversations with NPCs, and lamely fighting rats.  The interface is terrible.  You are very limited in what you can carry, so after you kill a monster you can't even carry your treasure back to town.  This "game" was all work with no fun.  Do not buy
- there are pros and cons of this card.PROS-its stores a lot of memoryable to save many files at one timecompactaffordableCONS-games that require 256 blocks will not be able to save!sometimes crashes.I tried saving with nhl 06 and it said it needed more memory. if you have a game that used 256 blocks get the gameshark 16x memory car
- Make no mistake, this is the memory card for you if you've got a Gamecube (which I'm assuming you do, or you're planning on getting one soon).  Anyway, there are 251 blocks on this baby, which may not seem like a lot, but it is.  It gets the job done, and you don't have to worry about it corrupting data or anything.  I've had mine for a while and nothing has happened to the files saved on there.  It's also easy to save and delete information from this thing with the simple click of a button.Please, don't get that damn third party memory card from Madcatz, my experience with that is corrupted data, and constant reformating of the card (which erases your files anyway).  Only go with Nintendo, they're the only ones who know the divine nature of their memory card. I must say, though, this is for the casual gamer.  Someone who doesn't have every game they can possibly get a hold of.  Some EA games, for exammple, take up over one-hundred blocks of memory.  Basically, what I'm saying is simple: If you're one who has a ton of games, you may find yourself buying more than one of these memory cards before you know it.  Not every game has a save for just the game.  Resident Evil, for example, saves on a different block every time.  Just like a playstation memory card.  If you're like me, however, you probably don't have THAT many games that it's a bother. The other thing I must caution is simple: This thing, like every other memory card, is small as hell.  This one even more so.  If you can, keep it plugged in your Gamecube at all times.  The great thing about memory cards, just about everyone of them, is simple: You can take them anywhere.  Does your same friend also own Super Mario Sunshine?  Hey, that's great, now you can leave your copy of the game at home and take your memory card.  It lightens the load. It's essential to have a memory card if you buy a Gamecube, and this is a good one.  If, however, you happen to be someone who has a TON of games, this won't hold you over long enough, and you'll have to buy another.No Gamecube owner should be without a memory card, though.
- I got this game during the summer expecting it to be great fun. Well...it caught my interest for a few weeks then I just got bored with it. I'd only recomend it to people who do not get bored easily
- Remember all those countless super hero licensed beat 'em up's that plagued 16-bit systems?  At first glance EA's Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects might not seem like that type of game, but make no mistake that it is: a repetitive and quickly boring beat 'em up with a host of technical issues.  You can play as a variety of Marvel Comics heroes and villains, as well as six "Imperfects": cyborg-esque warriors created specifically for the game.  The single player mode is ungodly repetitive as you battle hordes of generically created enemies.  This gets boring real quick, with button mashing galore and repetitive game-play.  The destructable environments seem like a good plus at first, but you'll soon learn how much they actually work against you in a brawl, and it becomes more frustrating than it should be.  The cumbersome control scheme adds to this, not to mention that the controls can get to be quite buggy as well.  The graphics look sharp from a distance, but the game has an odd look to it like it doesn't know if it wants to look like Spider-Man 2 or Ultimate Spider-Man (both are great games that are much more worth your time than this), and the in game cut scenes look godawful.  There are a few saving graces which save Marvel Nemesis from being a complete clunker, including a horde of unlockable content that comic fans will love.  The Marvel heroes' super powers are nicely pulled off, including Storm's weather attacks and Daredevil's agility, and the online support is where the most fun from the game is to be had.  Other than that though, there's not much else here to hold your interest.  If you're looking for a great super hero game, check out the X-Men Legends series or the aforementioned Ultimate Spider-Man.  If you're looking for a great beat 'em up, check out Rockstar's the Warriors; all of which are more worthwhile than this
+ If you liked Vice City, you'll love San Andreas. With more missions, car and character customizations and rival gang territories to take over, what could be better?The games biggest downfall is the familiar feeling you get after a while, however, the new and improved options easily make it a winner and well worth the cash. As a note, I had NO problems running this game with pretty much all options on high. I run a Dell 8300 3.0 HT, 1 GB ram, Radeon 9700 PRO and it flies!Strap up and get ready to defend your 'hood
+ This game, while simple in it's storyline shows us the depth and power of Disney matched with Square/Enix.  First Square and Enix merge, effectively bringing together the makers of two of the largest RPG's of all time (Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy).  Now, we have the perfect pairing of wit, humor, heart and pure Square story.  Based in many of the worlds from Disney Legends, your character Sora is a superb study in dynamic role playing.  The chains you can get going in Sora's attacks are amazing.  The extra battles in the sky over London and in the Hercules Arena are outstanding.  To learn this battle style, you must have wits of steel and thumbs of Orchaleum.  The battle against Sephiroth, one of the best known villians from the Final Fantasy series is awesome.  I never did beat Sephiroth but the battle was intense and I had him beaten to his knees several times.The bottom line is the sequel will be amazing as it revisits many of the same worlds and reinvents itself.  This game essentially creates a new genre, blending a soulful cast with characters from Disney lore.  The underpinning story is not to be missed, be sure you get the extended ending by following the Brady Games guide.  The summons are a bit hard to leverage but Tinker Bell comes in handy in some of the tougher battles.  360 degree rotating battles with the Shadow King in the sky above London and the final villian will thrill and captivate audiences of all ages.  The secrets hidden in the game are rightly difficult to find and awe inspiring in their execution.
+ I unlike a lot of other people did not buy this game when it first came out.  My initial thought was what was Squar thinking.  I was thinking this could be nothing more than a childs game.  It wasnt until I talked to a number of other people, right before KH2 came out did I finaly listen to all those people and spend the $20 to get the game, (as was the price of the game by then,) and low and behold, by the time I finished watching just the opening scene I was hooked.  I played that game for what seemed like hours on in, (it was really only a very long weekend.) But that game became so addicting I immediatly went out and bought the second one the day it came out.  The story line was on par with that of Final Fantasy X, and Final Fantasy VII, my two favorit games in the world. I would recomend this game to anyone with even the slightes bit of imagination.  If you can even dare to dream you will instantly love this game as I did.  It was well worth the price, and my only regret is that I did not buy it sooner
- This review is in reference to "Nancy Drew: Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon Game + Strategy Guide" edition. I've played 3 or 4 of the Drew games.  This one played faster and was over before the time it took to install the game. Before I had installed 'Blue Moon Canyon', I had installed "Morrowind the Game of the Year Edition", which sold for five dollars less than 'Blue Moon Canyon'.  Morrowind is a huge 4 disc game that has, at the bare minimum, 400 hours of game-play, and possibly might literally be endless.  The entire Morrowind set had been installed and up and running within 15-20 minutes. After I had installed and played 'Blue Moon Canyon' we installed and got up and running "Age of Mythology Gold" also within 20 minutes. This is another massive game, a Real Time Strategy game that included the expansion pack "The Titans". Both 'Mythology' games were completely installed.  This is another game that can be played and explored for years.  The two game set sold for five dollars more than 'Blue Moon Canyon', or the original full retail price of the strategy guide edition. "The Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon" took so long to download...we went out for dinner and let it download while we were gone.  We have a P4 at 3.2Ghz, an 80GB HD, of which only 23GB were used, and 1.5 GB of RAM.  There is no reason on earth why Nancy Drew games should take so long, over an hour, to download...unless their copy protection program conflicted with our Toshiba Super-Multi Drive drivers. The actual installation was not as painful as the download.  What was painful was the game-play.  I had a lot of fun playing the 'Secret of the Old Clock'.  Whereas most of the Amazon user reviews came across as lukewarm to the game, I liked playing the golf game, and the car chase, and the "bank shots" of reflective light beams to be aligned.  I even felt proud when I finally got the sewing completed. I knew that the Drew games wouldn't deliver the value that the two games (mentioned above) did.  But after the reading the reviews of 'Blue Moon' I expected to have more fun than I did with 'Secret', even though I knew it would be short lived.What a let down.  The game was over in two or three hours. Most of the game-play was a memory test of what order what button was pushed or stick was knocked over, or  which way the track leaned to.  The 'arcade' games in the General Store were just hit the button or in this case 'click the mouse'. You didn't even have to look.  The most complicated task was getting a piece of paper to do a rubbing. It was very boring. Between the price, the concern over the length of the download, the most unimaginative game-play set to walking back and forth on a train, I cannot recommend this game as being fun. It had a few moments with the Math/scale problems but it wasn't enough to carry the game or balance the huge amount of needless dialogue the player has to endure listening to. I realize I'm an adult, but the eight year-old little girl (I bought it for) lost interest after the first 15 minutes.  She was wiser than I. Sorry Nance, this one is a waste of money, and might contribute to hardware damage with driver conflicts.
+ when I started playing this game it was hard for me to stop I play it every chance I get and the best thing about it I got it for far less money from amazon.com
+ RPG fans won't want to miss this masterful follow-up to the legendary Chrono Trigger on Super NES. Chrono Cross has turned out to be one of those rare gems that manage that have all the qualities needed in order to make a truly memorable role-playing game experience. It does just about everything really well and does many things better than the original ever been did before. If you're a fan of RPGs, there's no doubt that you'll be pleased with this game and owe it to yourself to go out and buy it at your earliest convenience.First and foremost, the storyline in Chrono Cross is probably the most ambitious that any has ever been carried out in a console RPG, with the possible exception of Xenogears. The writing quality of Chrono Cross is exceptional and is nearly as good as the brilliant job that was done by the team responsible for Vagrant Story. What makes all of this even more impressive is that Square was able to give each of the game's 40-plus playable characters different characteristics and, in many cases, distinct accents and speech patterns. The accents were handled surprisingly well and most were pretty consistent throughout the entire game. That combined with the fact that each of the characters in the game plays an important role in the plot of the story help brings them to life as individuals. Without spoiling anything, the plot is very elaborate and deals with many issues, such as humanity's role in the destruction of the environment and how fate plays a role in our lives. Plus, it brings forth the idea of parallel worlds and how the outcome of one's life can be greatly effected by what happens during certain significant events in one's life. All of this has been pulled together nicely and the end result is one of the most intricate plots that one will ever encounter in a videogame. Not to be too cliched, but Chrono Cross is a truly epic role-playing game experience that has cemented its place in the annals of RPG history. It's easily one of the best RPGs currently available on PlayStation and has surpassed Vagrant Story as my personal favourite. If you're a fan of role-playing games, then you must go out and buy a copy of Chrono Cross
- I didnt like clue chronicles I sat there for 5 hours and still couldnt figure it out, I got so far and couldnt get any further. this was a waste of my money, if I could sell it I would, I like the regular clue better, that is why I bought this I thought it was something like the old one, when I seen it wasnt, I thought this might be fun, but as I was playing it I hated it more and more. I have sat down and tried this game 10 different times and I end up in the same spot and cant get no where else. I hate I
- We recommend not buying this game, unless you don't mind a buggy version that is not supported by Hasbro and can't be fixed.  Hasbro has decided not to support the game and the patches at the website are no longer available.  Save your money and wait for the next one, hopefully bug free
+ While it shares the Name "Chrono"  many people think it is a horrible sequel,  It in fact is not a direct sequel like so many people think it is.  It is a very well rounded and amazing game to play, It follows up twenty years after the Fall of lavos.  Keep in mind when playing this game that it is a Chronological sequel rather than a direct sequel that so many people fail to realize.While the game has numerous playable characters, it still maintains a very good story, if you follow it closely, but at times, can become very confusing if you miss certain details.  Chrono Cross will net you around 30-40 hours of game-play, and if you don't stop playing the game for extended amounts of time, the story just becomes completly amazing
+ I've had this game since the day it came out and some of the cutscenes my opinion are better than a lot of games out today. This games unique game-play I think adds to its satisfactory. I love everything about this game for example:music: this games music is unreal compared to practically every other ps1 game out there. IF you take the time to listen to it and your not one of those gamers like I used to be before I actually listened to any games music, than u will not be disappointed.game-play: I absolutely love this games game-play because of its unique style. Even though u cant really tell how much you have leveled up, you can still get the idea from when it gives u a new star so you can learn new moves and more slots for more space new put more skills.Charater and attack system: there are 40 characters in this game which I think all promote to there own indivituality from the others. Some of them may have the same same type and sometimes the same basic idea of a move, But each character is uniqely different looking than the others, a lot of them use different weapons, and armour. But the one I like most of all is the way that your special moves for each character get cooler looking and much stronger as you gain stars or levels. Some people say that getting so much more powerful attacks every level contributes to make this games battle system to easy. I don't think that at all because types of people had advantages over others so u have to know that. But even if you do, the enemies can heal more than you, and some enemies you have to run from because their so hard. So I don't think its that simple.Challenge level: I think overall this game is very challenging because of the battle system and because there is a countless # of puzzles to figure out in the game that definetly add to the games difficulty. I also think the games length adds to its challenge meter, because there are so many different paths you can take in the game to change the story line, so you can get different characters. So if you don't get some the first time you play, you can start another game with the same data and everything as the game before. So I think that this game is a game that you can't beat so easily in one day. I would recommend this game to anyone whos looking for a inexpensive rpg thats lengthy unique battle style and amazing everything else makes this ps1 game one of the best games ever created to date.
+ Had this game on our gamecube, so addicting then, now we have it on our DS and it is just as much fun. Only downside to it is it can be confusing as to how to unlock all the stuff.  You have to get a certain rating I believe, like A-D, nonetheless it is a great game, worth the money! If you have kids, the kids will thoroughly enjoy
+ If you are a DS owner, this game is a must-have.You will not be disappointed
+ What a fun game. The graphics are good. The stereo sound is awesome. There are plenty of tracks... and it's got multi-player. We've had a blast with this one. High quality fun from Nintendo
+ I got Shrek 2 a couple christmases (is that right?) ago, and I gotta say it was alright. the pros are that it is up to four players ( so if dad wants to spend "quality" time with junior), it has a wide variety of fun characters, and plenty of levels.  HOWEVER, it lacks graphics, and young children might not do well during the game. but overall its alrightGraphics: C/ It must have been released early, cuz it's pretty badSound: B+/ crisp sounds. the sound really matches the mood.Controls: A-/ Changing and controlling characters' a breezeGood for children and adults to
- I bought this game about a week ago. I had not purchased the prequil (so?) to this game and did not know what to expect. I began playing the game and immediately got bored about 30-45 minutes later. I have no played the game since. Here's why:The graphics, to me, are ridiculously annoying. It makes the game feel so unrealistic. The graphics are a step lower than "NBA Street" and even more unrealistic. The real problem is that there is just nothing to do. You enter tournements and they all feel the same. The little side missions are laughable, and I feel like turning off my Ps2 and smashing the controller on my head repetitively everytime I play one of them. I can go on and on about why I hated this game. But I won't. The bottom line is that I strongly urge you not to waste your money. The cover and appearance of the game appealed to me and made me want to buy the game...but don't let that happen to you
+ My just turned 6 year old can figure out 70% of the logic needed in this game, he can't do a VERY few of the tasks like fly the dragon to win that hero time and there was one stone monster boss guy I had to finally defeat for him.  BUT, he really likes this game, he "gets" the goals and can figure out with some hunting and trial and error how to get thru the chapters.  It has a tad more "killing" of stuff than I care for but what doesn't these days. He likes being able to be different characters, his favourite is Puss n Boots!As a grown up I enjoyed it as well, especially the humor
- After playing this game for the third time I had a thought, 'WHY DID I BUY THIS!' This game is extremely unoriginal and gets boring very quickly. I cannot notice any difference and improvements from the first ballers and other NBA Street's. Save your money and do not purchase this dreadful game
- First off, I cannot believe how mad this game has made me.  I like all kinds of games, but honestly trying to figure out some of the levels in this game left me stumped.  It's one thing to be stuck somewhere and have to retry a lot, but several times during this game I was stuck in an area and had no idea where to do/what to do, etc... even after I killed all the bad guys I didn't know how to get out of the room.  This game is not intuitive (so?) at all!Secondly, this game should not be called the Incredibles, it should be called Mr. Incredible, because you play as him almost all the time.  Playing as Elasta-Girl is great, I really enjoyed that part, but when there are a lot of baddies with guns, Mr. Incredible is a pain since he has no way to block anything, so you spend a lot of time getting pushed back until the bad guys reload.I liked the first mission as Dash (when you play as Dash, which is only twice) you have to run fast; however the second mission I just lost my patience because I had to restart about a million times because I couldn't see what was ahead of me.Playing a Violet was bad, they should have done a lot more with her instead of a boring stealth mission.  The Incredi-ball mission Incredibi-sucked, it took me like an hour to hit something because it was in a difficult place.I'm just finishing up the game now and quite frankly I haven;'t enjoyed a lot of it, which is a shame because I really loved the movie.  Some of the levels are too hard because you can barely find the way to do something and Mr. Incredible needs to do more than punch people.  Currently I'm on the Rocket Silo level and I keep falling down trying to get onto a platform.  What a load of fun that is to do 100 times or more.  Bottom line:  Playing as Elasta-girl was fun, everything else was either blah, or made me want to swear a lot.  Hopefully the second game will be better.  I'll be renting that instead of buying, this game left me disappointed overall
- Shouldn't you  people know by now?Say it with me:NEVER BUY MOVIE GAMES.A friend of mine bought it and it was horrible.It was way too easy to die in,etc,etc,etc.Hey listen.Keep you money.Your investment isn't in here
+ ...the graphics are pretty imbarasing. The object of the game is to get snapshots and you get these snapshots by completing missions, levels, and Hero Times (a specific mission were you use one character). Some of the levels are fun, like the Far, Far, Away level(it has a Grand Theft Auto Theme). I give the graphics a 3/5 (I think they should have done a better job on the main characters), audio 4/5, game-play 4.5/5, fun a 4.5/5, and an overall of 3/5.  
- the vertical stand is wonderful... but why? you can do this with 2 useless DVD cases and some duck tape... I put my PS slim vertically and it helps but why waste the time buying the product? I bought it just for kicks... literally
- poor quality ,out of box you can only play KQ7. almost useless very dispointed that they even sell this game as it is
- My gripe is about KQ6.  One customer said that there were no differences between the cd and disk versions. This information is false. At the time of its origional release, I was fortunate to have a high end computer (for its time) that was able to run the Windows CD version of KQ6 which had much better graphics and Character Illustrations. I was beyond upset when I found out that this was nothing but the DOS version. I bought this to play the windows version that to my knowlage does not work in any way on any OS past win95 (maybe 98). Those who have played and have been waiting to play the Windows CD version will be very upset
- I loved this game as a child and I spent many hours playing it. I was incredibly excited to be able to play it on my Laptop. OOPS they didn;t update any of the drivers for the first two games (Kings Quest 1and2) so after about 15 minutes of playing you can't see the screen due to all of the graphic errors. There are no patches available as of yet and it dosn't look like any are on the way. I feel pretty ripped off. It says on the cover in big print. "Runs on Windows XP." Barely, and not very well when it does. If you are interested in this game check to see if Vivendi has done any patches before you buy it or you will be disapointed. Better yet download one of the fan-made editions for free online. They work
+ The Incredibles is a fun 1 player game that puts you in the role of being The Incredibles even though it is short.Pros-Amazing Characters-Great Graphics-Intresting Plot-Footage from the movie can be accessed through the game as well as artworkCons-Short-Only 1 playerOverallIf you loved The Incredibles on the big screen you will like the game as well. The same plot and characters and great visuals are there but much it is not very lengthy
+ This game is fun to play but not the greatest game either. Of course the movie is way better than the game. The game is pretty easy and is short considering there are 18 levels. The storyline in the beginning could have been alittle better as well. Some of the missions are pretty hard but after you pass the tough ones it just gets easy again. All in all it's a good game. I would recommend it. The graphics are good , I do like how they put some storyline in from the movie. It's not to bad of a game to play.
+ I know how you feel about the Incredibales movie, it was incredibale but this game dismays the movie. Dash are faviorte character is forced to just run around in levels and avoid the enemys. Violet is just running around invisible. Elastigirl is probaly the best part of the game by swining around to the end of the level and the father is just beatin up bad guys. Plus the stupid voice of frozone gets kindof annoying after awhile. Wasn't the whole point of the movie about famile and teamwork and theres no I in team. Well you are all by you're self in this playing one charcter per level. Please note all movies made into games are ba
- After all the Hype about this game I bought it...well in my opinion it just felt flat on its face. The game simply is not very intersting and the storyline can be plain boring. There are other RPGs out there that are better and you simply get immersed in the story line quickly. The battles get boring extremely quickly since all you do is kinda point and tap the same guys over and over. The "costumes" and "decals" are kinda stupid. Many said this was the next EARTHBOUND, well is NOT and not even close. The Nintendo DS has so much potential and this game does not deliver in graphics, sound , game play and fun. don't get me wrong the game is not horrible by any means but defitnetly not that good either. check out some reviews out there before you buy it
- This second part of Xenosaga compares very badly to the stellar first part, regardless of what anyone says.  I no longer wanted to play this game after only 30 minutes.The game begins with lots of boring instructions for a very non-intuitive battle system.  Annoying amount of experience points is needed to defeat nearly every main enemy, including the very first one.  Battle result and saving screens are a painful chore.Battle camera is inadequate and characters look and act like small puppets.  The game has very few items, weapons, or armour to deal with even ordinary enemies, which are stronger than expected.  The skill combination that will be successful on a main enemy is not available until engaged by that enemy.  Battles with main enemies are long, which isn't such a problem.  However, they often conveniently power up at the end of the battle, just to frustratingly finish off a battle-weakened party.Voice acting is very uninspired and sometimes even annoying.  I don't remember any music from this game, so plain it is.  Some character changes are likely to upset at least half of everyone who liked the first Xenosaga.  Very noticeable is the use of swearing, which is the main reason I don't enjoy or watch Hollywood movies during my rest and relaxation anymore.New, meaningless characters have been introduced into the story, and the focus shifted far away from the main characters.  The cover character hardly says or does anything this time.  There is one short scene between the main characters during a critical moment, but if you blink you will miss it.This game is far more frustrating than challenging, which is not a good game trait.  I don't recommend even playing this game before reading the above, to fully prepare for the disappointment that awaits.  If you're looking forward to anything that made the first Xenosaga great, you will be extremely disappointed.  The second Xenosaga is better completely avoided.
- I loved the first Xenosaga. Then, this arrived. Episode 2 isen't a bad game in terms of the story, the intro is absolutely DYNAMITE. Then you get into a battle. Now, if you like tactical stuff, this is a good game for you. But if you're trying to fight your way through a hoard of enemies to get to a save point in record timing, I say save your money. Gone is the amazingly well-done battle system in the first episode. In its place stands a completely out-of-nowhere new way of battling that takes 15 minutes to get rid of a couple of easy enemies( the easy ones in this game have around 2000 Hps). Ridiculous, but that's not all. The enemies have weak "zones" that depend of the height of the attack that you input.The zones are A,B and C, A being the highest. Triangle=C, square=B and Circle=A -SOMETIMES-. See what I mean? It's completely screwed-up and you have to become deeplyaddicted to the game to understand its full potential. And if       that wasn't enough, they changed the voice actors too. Kos-Mos's voice sounds more like an operator than a robot's and Momo sounds like a brat. At least, chaos' voice has improved. I'd prefer playing episode 1 twice than playing this. I just hope Namco comes out with a better sequel, otherwise spend your moey on something else (like Shadow Hearts, for example).    
- Pros:- Mechs are a bigger part of the games (you actually have to use them),- The graphics of the cutscreens are great, and the graphics overall are better    than before,- A couple of the characters look better,- Much harder than Episode I,- More optional bosses,Cons:- New battle system is a load of mouse spunk (can I say spunk?),- Most characters look worse (especially Kos-Mos), and Jin travels   throughout space with no pants on,- Almost all of the sidequests are terrible,- Very short,- The story is much weaker,- The dictionary is gone; and so are Shion's glasses,- No shops. Why are there no shops?- Too much more to list.  Just bad.  The movie "Howard the Duck" is better than   this
- We got this game free in a box of Corn Chex. We thought, Oh this will be fun since the show is cool. So we got home and played it and it was so annoying! There's just like a black screen before and after the question shows up and a black background. Just, don't buy it if you want to have any fun
+ What can be better than a game made for adults or kids?  Sly, sneaky humor that only adults will understand with the greatest toy ever created Legos!  All in the theme of the best of the Star Wars movies!!Many games put in 'replayability' by allowing you to go through the game or missions a second or third time with a different character, but Lego Star Wars does this in a fashion that is totally fun.  It's not a simple regurgitation of the map with a different character (wihoo replayable...) but rather an ingenious method that rewards you with additional pieces for building as well as secret areas that were previously unobtainable.  For instance, you might need a Stormtrooper (or uniform), a Jedi (dark or light), or even a Bounty Hunter to enter specific areas.  Droids are often used to access areas as well, but you usually have them during the missions.  Using 'free play' mode, you can go back through the missions with a character you created, or any other character you have unlocked.  During the mission, you can cycle through your characters and use their abilities.  This allows you to go back and unlock new areas and find additional bricks etc.  The fact that there are new abilities with characters you find later as well as new areas to explore really makes the replayability fun and worthwhile.Another aspect to this game that I absolutely love is cooperative play.  This is great for adults to be able to play along with the kids, or even spouses.  My wife doesn't play a lot of Xbox titles, but she loves playing this game and we have a blast going through the missions together.  I'm surprised more games don't actually give you coop play like this.  Seems it's enough to toss in death match and label the game as 'multiplayer'. My only complaint is with the camera, both in single and cooperative mode.  Often times the camera will shift based on one of the players and force the other player back towards the center of the screen.  On more than one occasion, this has caused death to the characters or when we get stuck forces one of the players to swap characters midstream.  Sometimes this isn't obvious to the player.  It would have been really nice to have the option of split screen, especially with the real estate an HDTV provides. All in all, I would highly recommend this game.  Especially if you have kids and want to spend some quality time with them. Great game
- When Disney Interactive released "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," in early 2000, they anticipated a very warm response to the disc, which had a firm but low opening price. However, when actually being played, the game is sure to depress. If it isn't crudely simple, the design is poor and uninspired. The entire game is essentially based on one lackluster thing: Regis Philbin repeating the same phrases over and over again. "Be Sure to come back to... Who Wants to be a Millionaire." "I hope you'll join me again on... Who Wants to be a Millionaire." If one doesn't decide to resell (or simply trash) this game within its first week of purchase, they work for Disney Interactive or are Regis themselves. Don't waste your time on this pitiful effort
+ Though I was daunted a little by the reviews stating problem with installing the game I went for it and I don't regret. I bought the Platinum Edition and it installs all right. The good thing about the platinum edition is that you get three games at the same time.        Would not say it's one of the very bests available in its category but it's interesting and fun. About graphics, though the details are not great, still I liked the 3-D view, specially the view through the eyes of the main character(Hero).       Story is so so. Dialogs are specially bad. But the fact that you have to follow certain clues and talk to people and find out useful information is good idea. A sort of combination of RPG and RTS.             I like the units and the way they fight. Also picking up artifacts or weapons is good.Overall it's a nice game. And the platinum edition is specially good as you get lots of hours of game-play
- I am extreamly dissapointd with this game.  Every section and mission is exactly the same with the exception of the location.  There is absolutly no skill involved in beating the game which I was able to do in 3 sittings. 
- Hey, have you ever played Caesar II from the 1990s? Yeah, well this game is basically a knock-off of that game with better graphics. And quite frankly, Caesar II was more fun. I don't see how CivCity has any point. You build your city and nothing interesting ever happens. There is no progression to the game that keeps it fresh. The makers intergrated technologies and wonders from the successful Civilization game series, but they are inconsequential in this game. These people should stick to what they are good at, the Civilization series, and leave city games to people who know how to do it. I've heard that a new installment of the Caesar series is out now, Caesar IV, and I haven't tried it, but it has to be better than CivCity Rome. This game is boring, don't pay any money for it.
- I brought this after having played Caesar3 and loved it but wanted something with a bit more scope for controlling dynamics of a city - and I thought being a civcity game this would offer me the extension - WRONG - this is a bad rip off of Caesar3, sure, graphics are more advanced with the zoom in view but other than that I was playing the same game but with less involvement or control. This is a sit back and let it happen to you game - keep the people happy and build everything and they'll stay. Caesar IV - that's what you're wanting, it looks like everything this sets itself up to be that it isn't. Feel like I've wasted my money
- I was really looking forward to this game, and I was prepared to overlook one or two things.  Every game has it's own personality, right?  I found instead this game actually doesn't have much of one at all.  I didn't mind the graphics.  Not cutting edge sure, but not that bad either.  A little muddy but a change from cartoony.  It was hard to enjoy closeup views, however, when so many buildings lost their roof on zoom.  No way to toggle that feature.  The camera angles were frustrating and it was very difficult to pick anything out with the mouse accurately.  Not that there was much time to look at the scenery.  Immigrants came.  And came.  And came.  Whether there were houses and jobs available or not.  As long as city happiness was high enough, which meant that everyone was happy.  Which they were not.  Because they had no houses or jobs.  To keep city happiness up was the only way to ensure a somewhat stable economy.  Forget planning.  Forget balancing resources with workshops and markets.  It wasn't clear what the balance was in any case.  It would take trial and error, and you didn't have the time.  For you were building worshops like mad, trying to guess at how many citizens would be employed by each, and researching for temporary bumps to keep your city from being deserted in droves.  The best income boosts were not through sale of goods or trade.  It was through research, maximising the tax base with the development of currency and so on.  You hit those early on, and reached a certain population level, you made money.  The rest of the time you spent trying to keep people from leaving.  There was no stability in reaching any level.  It quickly became a game of keep up.  There was no way to control immigration or set the pace of development.  And for all the decorative options, more than the similar games out, you really didn't care in the end what your city looked like, because it just cost time.  Money too, but that was really not the relevant issue.  Unless people were unhappy.  Then you could stick a few things, quickly, somewhere.  You just can't enjoy a leisurely pace of planning, building and finishing it off with a nudge here and there and watching it run...you have to be constantly involved in the process, staying ahead of the curve.  You don't have to worry about maintenance, such as city fires or engineers, but the cities cannot not be made self-sufficient or self-sustaining with this inherent instability built into the game-play.  Five or ten minutes away from the screen will bring most cities, if not all, to a screeching halt.While I enjoyed the research options, and the ability to move homes I thought was a great innovation, not having the ability to control the flow of immigrants to the city and pegging success to city happiness makes this game a poor economic simulation and the game-play ultimately very shallow and unsatisfying.
+ I've never played real time strategy games before because I primarily play RPG's. This game combines the best elements of both and I've enjoyed playing it immensly. I look forward to playing part 2 after completing it a couple more times with different characters
+ Essentially, this Platinum Edition DVD is three games for a bargain-bin price. I couldn't pass it up. I had a little trouble getting it to launch at first, but after a little Internet session, I was back in the world of RPG/RTS hybrid excellence. The seamless integration of the two elements makes for a truly unique experience. Unlike other RTS games, there are many adventure elements, and you aren't just plunked down on each map; you have to fight your way from map to map. Unlike other RPG games, your hero won't be able to go it alone; to defeat the foes that lay in their path, he/she will have to call upon the power of armies from six different races: Human, Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Trolls, and Dark Elves. Your avatar must find structures known as rune monuments to access his/her unique power of using runes to summon forth rune heroes and armies. The RPG element of the game is limited essentially to the character you create at the beginning. Your avatar, a rune warrior, is a remnant of powerful heroes that served the Circle Mages during the time of The Convocation. The avatar is completely under your control; you choose the name, equipment, gender, and distribute skill points and stat points as they gain levels to create a unique character. You can create a punishing melee fighter, a powerful sorcerer, a deadeye archer, or any combination of those and other concepts. Your avatar can also summon rune heroes as he/she goes along; these heroes are other rune warriors whose levels and classes are fixed, so all you can do is equip them with the best available items. As you progress through the game, you can find more powerful hero runes to summon better heroes at the hero monuments.The RTS element is a continuation of the system started in Warcraft, but with a few twists. You must find a rune monument for one of the six races (human monument, dwarf monument, etc.), and possess the appropriate worker rune, building plans, and unit plans to summon an army. Once you summon your workers, they can gather resources and build the necessary structures to summon an army. The need to have the appropriate building and unit plans occasionally necessitates fully exploring each map, so as to not miss any. The levels of your military units depends on the level of the worker rune you used to summon your workers, so as you find higher-level worker runes your units will gain levels and become stronger. Heart of Winter and Shadow of the Phoenix help add dozens of hours to the original Order of Dawn campaign, granting you access to higher levels, more powerful equipment, new heroes, and more advanced units. One of my favorites was the "Walking Fortress" troll unit that hurls massive boulders at enemy structures. You can import your avatar from The Order of Dawn into both expansions, allowing this hero to complete an epic adventure. Shadow of the Phoenix is very challenging and has some of the most ridiculous boss fights I have ever seen. Several of them require your avatar, the rune heroes, and a full army to bring down a single foe. Heart of Winter is an excellent continuation of The Order of Dawn, adding new friends and enemies, and Shadow of the Phoenix is a harrowing and challenging test of strategy and patience as your rune hero moves towards their ultimate destiny.To sum it up, this DVD has plenty of adventurous RTS/RPG action wrapped around an engrossing fantasy yarn that should provide dozens of hours of quality entertainment. Highly recommended.   
- The Civ name has been tarnished.  Analogously, one thing I have been learning is that just because Sid Meier's name is on a product, it doesn't mean the product is good.In the case of CivCity: Rome, unfortunately, it doesn't just come in at "modestly good" - it comes in at "dismally poor."  I've tried hard not to let this influence my beliefs about Civilization in general, but after Civ4 came out, I am starting to believe that Firaxis Games and Sid Meier are on their way out.  And now this...I regret to inform that the great Civ titles were made a long time ago.  The offerings of today have a simple pattern: the production was rushed and the title came out with major bugs; the games add unnecessary features designed to justify the overall cost; and the consumers are often abused with ridiculous expansion packs containing features that should OBVIOUSLY have been included in the original release - they take advantage of our love for the franchise.This pattern is so evident that the whole Sid Meier and Civ franchise is degenerating.  It almost seems, especially with the release of CivCity: Rome, that we are once again expected to simply drop cash for new products based on our love for the old.  But the developers are not living up to our expectations for producing great games!Stay away from CivCity: Rome.  Besides the obvious blunders associated with all the bugs, you will see that even the best patch cannot make the graphics look good, the narration and sound effects better, or the interface to work properly.  The game is a dismal failure, and I am sorry to report that.  It seems like Firefly Studios had an idea and got the license from Firaxis, but they just cheesed it.Watching what Maxis (The Sims and SimCity franchises) and Firaxis (Civilization franchise) are doing to their most loyal fans is like watching your dad get drunk
- It has pretty much all been said, let's just say it again 'cause I'm sure Firaxis/Firefly will plant positive reviews here. The game takes ages to load, the voice acting is silly (British? Australian? Herman's Hermits?), the progression is totally linear (ie the game fails to become more complicated at higher levels), the graphics date to 2002, and the citizen 'fetching' system is completely random and opaque. Sit and watch for awhile: your huts will change size every thirty seconds. Most importantly, boo Sid, boo. You could've produced this bad Caesar3 ripoff and called it anything, but you called it "CivCity", and even put a tiny Civilopedia in it. Haven't you got enough money? The Civ Series is brilliant. Don't cash it in
- The games faults have been well covered already so I'll just say, if a Roman era city builder is what your looking for save your money and wait for Ceasar IV. Afer playing the demo I can say that this will be a FAR superior game than civcity on every level. It seems to be the game the makers of civcity were trying to make but failed miserably.
+ Worth the money, get lots of hours out of it, yet is closr to warcraft/civilization style gam
+ I had an old skool ds, and it was ok. When they released the lite, I was skeptical about it. It was right after the Microsoft 360 scandal, and I was critical of new technology. I wanted to wait until it had been out a few months to pick one up, to see if it had any glitches. I'm glad I waited, because they released the coral pink one! I picked it up the first day, and it's so adorable and perfect. The ability to change the light levels is great, the old ds was hard to play outside because you couldn't really adjust the lighted screen.It's a soft pink color, glossy, and tiny. I marveled at it's size compared to the old ds. It's super hot. The charger from the old ds DOES NOT fit into the ds lite, so if you have the old charger/old car charger it won't work. :( That's not such a big deal since it comes with a charger, but I was kinda sad that the old car charger wouldn't fit. The stylus is better, with a soft rubber tip instead of the hard plastic one the old ds had. The colors on it are amazing! The sound is pretty loud, I find that I don't have to have it up very much to hear it fine. I'm glad nintendo finally realized that not every gamer is a d00d.
- Like the other reviews, I find this game a rip-off of Caesare III. (I didn't know there was a IV! Must look into that.) While the graphics are admirable, the game-play wasn't challenging at all. It didn't take me any time at all to win, and I'm one of the worst game players ever. OTOH, it's a good afternoon waster if all you want to do is build and perfect your city in open play with no goals. Don't buy it now. Wait until it's cheap, like $9.95 or something.
- I swear if it wasn't that I liked final fantasy 7 and 8 so much I'd just break this game at then I'd move on and be happy. But I can't do that because that would be waste of money the only thing that kept me in the game was the fact that I did'nt want to waste money. This game makes kingdom hearts look like a M rated game. Oh my god this is so childish. You know how in most final fantasy games they try to make the main character cool they didn't feel like doing that in this one. You are a monkey-man! How stupid is that. Plus the other character are way more dumb looking that the main one mi just happy I beat in and can put that awful exp. behind me. AHHHHHHHHHH
- Graphics aren't the most important part of a game to me.  I already owned Oblivion when I bought Gothic 2 because I was hoping it would be a darker and more mature "Oblivion" style RPG.  While it does have much more mature content than Oblivion,.. I never got to see it because of the bad controls,.. bad collision and lack of fun.  (By bad collision I'm talking about your character walking through or getting stuck on objects.)   The only weapons you can find at first are a tree branch and a tiny dagger.  There are no easy enemies to fight for a Level 1 character.  Even the little gremlin looking guys in the first cave by that pond at the beginning totally beat the crap out of you with ease.  The controls make combat an unfun chore.  I'm a patient and forgiving gamer but Gothic 2 barely has half the quality of Elder Scrolls 4 : Oblivion.  If you've never played Oblivion and don't have an XBox 360 or a PC that can run it,.. then maybe you'll get into Gothic 2.  It has much lower system requirements
+ Nintendo DS Lite (2006.) INTRODUCTION: In late 2004, Nintendo premiered the Nintendo Dual Screen, or Nintendo DS for short. Despite the skepticism from many critics and fans alike, the new console quickly won audiences over. It was Nintendo's best handheld console to date. And in 2006, Nintendo released a smaller, lighter version of the system, appropriately called the DS Lite. OVERVIEW: Nintendo released the DS Lite in mid 2006. The new version of the system is smaller than the old version, features repositioned buttons/switches/etc, variable brightness levels, and a few other changes from the classic DS. It retails for about $130.00 and comes in three colors - White, Black, and Pink. REVIEW: Nintendo did a good job revising the DS. Many problems with the older version of the system are fixed. Here are some of the highlights and flaws of the new version. -THE GOOD- -SMALLER AND MORE COMPACT THAN THE ORIGINAL DS. The original DS was rather bulky in comparison to some other handhelds on the market, and it was kind of a pain to haul around. Finally, we've got a smaller, lighter version of the system that can easily be transported. -VARIABLE BRIGHTNESS LEVELS. You can adjust the brightness to your liking with this version of the DS. Brighter levels use more battery power, lower levels use less, so you can plan out how best to use your battery's life. -FEATURES A CLIP IN THE GAME BOY ADVANCE SLOT. Unlike the original DS, the Lite version includes a clip that goes in the slot where Game Boy Advance games fit. This helps to give the system a streamlined appearance, and it keeps that slot cleaner. -COMPATIBLE WITH THE E-READER. The old DS, due to its shape, couldn't use the E-Reader accessory. The Lite model's shape is better all around, and it can use it! -AVAILABLE IN THREE COOL COLORS. Whether you want white, black, or pink, there's a color for everyone. -REPOSITIONED BUTTONS AND THINGS. Nintendo made the system more convenient to use by moving the buttons around to spots that are easier to use. -REDESIGNED STYLUS. The new stylus is bigger and thicker than the ones with the old DS, and is an all-around improvement. -COMPATIBLE WITH THE OLDER DS. Since it's basically the same system, you won't have any compatibility issues. -THE BAD- -SMALLER ISN'T NECESSARILY BETTER IN EVERY WAY. I have big hands and they fit the old DS fine. Shrinking it actually makes it a little harder, in some aspects, to use all of the buttons. -STILL NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PRE-GAME BOY ADVANCE GAMES. Of course I wasn't really expecting Nintendo to fix this. -STILL NOT COMPATIBLE WITH GAME BOY ADVANCE MULTI-PLAYER. Another thing I wasn't expecting fixed. OVERALL: Overall this is a nice improvement over the original DS. There are problems, but for the most part, just the same problems the original had. If you haven't gotten a DS yet, definitely go for the Lite model. EDITION NOTES: The DS Lite is relatively new and should be in stores for years to come.
+ People will no doubt find the Nintendo DS Lite to be a way for Nintendo to sucker people out of their money. It can be that way, if you think of yourself as a sucker, but for me the DS lite is a little better. Simply put, if you're content with your original DS, then don't even waste time to buy this one. If you don't have a DS period, the DS Lite is a much better investment than the original bulky one.With the DS Lite, game-play is made a little simplar. The button placement and brighter screen make the game-play a little better. For one, the start and select buttons have been moved to resemble where they were on the original Gameboy Advance. This makes handling some of the functions (especially for GBA games) a lot easier. The buttons, sadly, are a still a little small for guys with big hands like myself.The DS Lite also comes with a phony GBA cartridge (called a "cap"). If you don't have a GBA game plugged into the system, you can put in the phony cartridge to keep it from collecting dust in there. However, when you do stick in a GBA game, it sticks out by about a centimeter. It just looks weird. The cap does, at least, keep the system looking good.Perhaps the most welcome change to the DS Lite is the screen. The original DS screen was not exactly bright. In fact, it was, in comparison the DS Lite, rather dark. Games like Metroid Prime Hunters were darker than they had to be. On this new screen, the difference in how bright the games appear really shows. Not only that but, you can adjust the brightness if need be. It doesn't really affect the battery life, either. You can play the DS Lite for as long as you played the original. And also like the original, it charges while you play.Another welcome difference is the touch screen itself. These screens last a lot longer than the original DS. Those who have an original DS no doubt experienced a lot of scratches on their screen from their stylus. To the point where it was noticeable. You could still see the screen, but it was apparent that the stylus was doing a number on it. The screen is more protected here. The stylus doesn't scratch the screen quite as easily. In other words, the touch screen lasts a lot longer.The DS Lite also looks better, and fits in your pocket better. It also performs all the tasks of a regular DS. For example, if you're playing a game and you suddenly have to go, just flip it closed and it sleeps. There's also a place to store the stylus, and the stylus is better too. It's a little bigger and thicker, so it's not quite as easy to lose.Some problems with the original DS still plague the DS Lite however. You still can't play Gameboy Color or regular Gameboy games on the DS Lite. Also, you still can't configure the controls to play a GBA game much easier. In other words you can't configure "X" and "Y" when you play a GBA game. This probably won't bother you in the long run, however. Also, the touch screen still has its sensitivity. Touching the touch screen with your bare hands is more dangerous than the stylus scratching the screen. The oils from your fingers might damage the screen and therefore, it won't respond to the touch of even your stylus.When the original DS launched, owners will note that there were not very many good games availible. About the only good game during its launch in 2004 was Super Mario 64 DS. Now there are plenty of games out there (and not all of them are ports), so if you do want a DS, this is a great time to get one, and the DS Lite is a better investment than the original one by far.The DS may not play movies, or MP3 players, but to be honest, that almost defeats the purpose of a gaming system. Am I looking to buy a portable entertainment center? Of course not, I'm looking to find a system to play some of my games on, and the Nintendo DS delivers. Real gamers know it's about the games, not about the bells and whistles of a system. For the casual gamer, the Nintendo DS delivers, and the DS Lite is a fine improvement.The Good+Vastly superior to the original DS+It fits in your pocket easier+The Screen is much brighter+Touch screen is more durable+The placement of the Start and Select buttons is easier+A better stylus+The battery life is unchangedThe Bad-Those with an original DS, who want a DS Lite will have to spend more money for yet another DS-Some of the cons of the original DS are still her
- The controls are very difficult and I understand they wanted "realism" but they killed a lot of fun by making you just so damned vulnerable to EVERYTHING.  I'm a long-time gamer and I can handle a tough game but this is just frustrating to the extreme.  Plus for all the people talking about immersion...I just don't see it.  I just couldn't get myself to care about the world or story I was in; it didn't grab me like some games do
- Bought this game on the strength of some reviews here but I was very dissapointed with it. Clunky control system really put me off
- The concept for this game is strong, and it's got some cute ideas, but the voice recognition - especially for the word "blue" - and the character recognition is abysmal.  It makes the "game" an exercise in frustration, more than anything else.  As to character recognition...unless you write in whatever font the game is programmed to recognize, it's going to record your answers as something different than what you wrote.You are penalized when the system doesn't recognize "blue" or the correct number.  If the system is so rigid that it only accepts one way of saying "blue", then the system should have a sound file that tells you what it wants to hear.  As to the number recognition, it should have a screen that shows you how the system wants the numbers written, or it should be able to allow you to enter your numbers and correlate them to numbers within the system.  (When I make this mark, it = 4)Also, the "intro" content is absurdly long, with no way to skip over it.  Huge waste of time after the first 10x you've seen it.  I just got the game today, and I've spent hours trying to figure out a way to say blue such that the game will recognize it...now, I just wish I could return opened software.  I'm very frustrated with the entire experience
- Everyone seemed really excited about this game; supposed to be a great launch title, etc. Turns out that Red Steel fails to deliver like Dominoes during a hurricane. The graphics are meh (Ubisoft could have done way better), and controls are a bit awkward. This isn't because of the Wii controller itself... having played Zelda and Wii sports, I can say that the controller works very very well. So I am inclined to think that the bulkiness of shooting in Red Steel, and the fact that using your sword is more like clubbing a baby seal then fighting with the grace of a master samurai, has to do with the game design, not any fault of the controller. The storyline isn't that amazing either. Pretty straight-forward neverending quest to save your girlfriend (brownie points if you got the pop culture reference!), shoot a lot of Japanese people in the process. Nothing innovative to see here, move along now. It could have been a lot better. I'm selling this one back to EBgames and getting Trauma Center instead. Disappointing launch title.
- This was the first Wii game I got, and its mostly because I couldn't get a hold of Zelda.  Red Steel looks promising.  Certainly its controls are good, but it feels more like a game that's supposed to get you used to using the remote and nunchuck attachment.  A tutorial of sorts.  The problem is that it isn't much fun to deal with. You play as Scott, a man in Japan with his girlfriend.  You suddenly find out that her father is a Yakuza Mob boss and that he's got tons of enemies.  Your girlfriend gets kidnapped and so its up to you to save her, ultimately getting yourself involved in this family struggle.  It's pretty simple stuff.  Most of the game is told through voice acted cutscenes or graphic novel like storyboards.  The graphic novel storyboards look interesting, but its really painful that you can't skip any of these cinematics or storyboard cutscenes.  This is especially annoying when you die and you have to listen to the same objective over and over again. Red Steel's appeal is its game-play, which seems to be the focus of the game.  The controls are solid, for the most part, but again, the whole game seems like a tutorial to get used to the Wii remote.  You use the remote to aim at enemies and the B button to shoot.  The nunchuck allows you to pick up weapons, reload said weapon and tip over tables (you'll know what can be accessed because it has a golden outline around it).  The nunchuck is also how you'll move around.  You can strife from side to side and you can move forward.  The nunchuck also allows you to jump and duck.  You'll be doing a lot of ducking.The remote is responsible for most of the game-play.  It allows you to turn from one side of the screen to another.  The game itself will help you get adjusted with a tutorial provided at the beginning of the game (with your grifriend directing you what fish to look at).  You'll be able to use the remote for several things.  You can lock onto enemies with the A button and if you hold the A button you can zoom into enemies by moving the wii remote closer to the screen, or you can zoom out.  It's all pretty cool, but the remote is extremely sensitive.  Just the slightest flick to the left and you'll look to the left.  It's great to actually point and shoot at an enemy, your accuracy is really important, but now it's all up to you whether or not you hit an enemy.  Granted, the controls take time to get used to, but they flow particularly well. Swordfights are another story, though.  These are annoying sequences actually.  Mostly because the controls are clumbsy.  You'll have to swing your sword using the wii remote and you'll parry and dodge attacks using the nunchuck.  At first this is fun, but its so limited.  When fighting with swords you can't pull out a weapon.  This is bad when you're in the middle of a firefight and some guy has a sword.  You'll be forced into the sword fight even when all the enemies using guns are still up.  And they'll STILL fire at you and you'll lose health.  There's no way to back out of sword fights either, and that's also really annoying.  The controls just feel clumbsy as well, especially with its extreme sensitivty.  To the game-play's credit, there are some interesting things you can do.  For starters, when you're not shooting someone and you're ducking behind something, your health refills.  At first this makes the game seem easy, but you have to understand that if you're taking damage, or shooting at all, your health doesn't refill.  So this doesn't make the game incredibly easy.  Also, after a sword fight, you'll have the choice of finishing your attacker off or sparing his life.  Sparing his life earns you respect, which you can use to learn more techniques.  The game doesn't look fantastic, but it's not bad looking either.  It's visual presentation is alright, but the part of the graphics that lacks are the games numerous bugs and glitches.  There are moments where you'll be staring an enemy right in the face and he won't move.  Won't flinch or even attack you.  He just stands there waiting to be killed.  Sometimes enemies will run right past you or claim they can't see you when you're in plain sight.  There are also moments where I shot an enemy in the back and neither him nor his comrades even acknowledged my existence.  There are probably more bugs than this found within the game, but it was hard to take after a while.    There are a couple of other annoying aspects of the game-play as well.  You can only hold two weapons at a time.  This isn't as annoying as it sounds, but I wish I could've held on to more.  Luckily, ammo is not hard to come by at all.  There are also glitches such as your bullets passing right through an enemy while he takes you out.  Enemies shooting through walls.  This game is just full of them.I wish I could say it sounds good, but it doesn't.  The voice acting is very mediocre and the soundtrack isn't great either.  Some levels sound good, but there's nothing memorable here.  Red Steel has a good control scheme going for it but that's really all it has going for it.  It's not a fantastic game by any means.  The bugs and glitches strewn throughout are also just really annoying.  It's hard to recommend this game, even to die hard first person shooter fans. The Good+The control scheme works+Well, there is lots of actionThe Bad-Tons of bugs and glitches found throughout the whole game: enemies who don't attack, or walk right past you.  Enemies who can't see you in plain sight.  Bullets going through walls or through your enemies... this game is full of them and they detract from the game-play-Sword fighting is clumbsy-You can only wield two weapons at once. -When you're forced into a sword fight, there's no way you can get out of it until the fight is over-Horrible voice acting-There's really no story to it-The controls, while good, just seem like another ploy to get one used to the Wii Remot
+ I have been a staunch Final Fantasy fan for years. While waiting for the newest release, which kept being pushed back, I tried out Xenosaga. Let me tell you, I am grateful I have!This game is one of the most entertaining and interesting games I have ever played. The world is absolutely amazing and the characters are unique, not to mention a plot that has profound depth. You will fall in love....trust me. If you are looking for an rpg that will draw you in and keep you playing for hours, it is Xenosaga
- I really wanted to like this game.. unfortunately for me, it blows. I'd trade it for a migraine if I could. The game-play is pretty horrible, the sword scenes are reminiscent of PC adventure games circa 1992, where you press the "Attack" key and  swing your sword aimlessly at the bad-guy. The runandgun part of the game is nothing to write home about either. It feels like being teleported into the body of a cracked-out, 1 legged, drunken monkey. Also, I know the graphics aren't the Wii's strong-point, but that is no excuse to regress back to 8-bit. When you're trying to shoot someone across the room, it really sucks when you can't tell them  apart from a flower pot.....or is that a lawn chair?The cut scene's were obviously supposed to look like Sin City. I stress the word SUPPOSED cause they were probably strung together by some poor intern after the development team went into hiding. They look like an amateur flash slide-show. Kinda like what your local momandpop video editor would have put together if your little nephew had gotten his way and had a Sin City themed Bar Mitzvah.This game is a joke. Anybody associated with it should be embarrassed.
- Playing Icewind Dale II reminds me of all of those novels written by American authors in the late 19th century. Though many of the novels were very well written, they never seemed to suck me in and continue reading the book. Icewind Dale II is like that. It looks nice, it supposedly improves game-play, and it gives the player more character creation options, but I just don't really want to play it. Why? Well, at the end of the day, it seems as if Icewind Dale II is hurt by a extremely corny story; it is bogged down in numerous irrelevent puzzles involving you running around constantly; it is just not as fun as its predescessor. I bought this game for one reason and that reason was that I was addicted to Baldur's Gate II and needed to expand my party based rpg addiction to another realm. Icewind Dale II seemed to be the logical option. I was wrong. I was immediately confronted with a story so corny that it is almost embarassing to take part in. I was confronted with game-play that caused me to run back and forth from one place to another constantly. I was confronted with battles so easy that I was soon bored. I tried to play it again, but again I was plagued with the same problems. I installed a bunch of unofficial patches, but those did not solve the problems with the terrible puzzles and whatever else. The overload of puzzles and corniness would be ok if you could diverge from the one path as you could in Baldur's Gate II, where you could accomplish quests at the order that you wanted to. Here you had to accomplish everything in a linear order and could never diverge from the path. Furthermore, the story seemed to be a retread of the story from the original Icewind Dale. In fact, the design of the game seemed to paralell it completely. The final problem with this game concerns the fact that it is difficult to play if you have no knowledge of dungeons and dragons rules. If you do not know how to use rogues or are unfamiliar with feats and the like, this game will pose a very high learning curve that you may not want to climb. I was mostly familiar with the rules, but it was easy to see that someone who did not know them as well could easily make mistakes or be unfamiliar with the use of certain classes (even though the rule book was pretty exhaustive). All in all, I do not think that this is a good game. I would just go with Baldur's Gate II or Icewind Dale I instead of this game.
- Firstly, I have been a big fan of the aurora engine for PC based RPG games.  I loved BG 1 and 2 plus the first IWD but the sequal to which I found, to be honest, awful.  I was raised with the 2nd edition rule set and I have never played the 3rd (with the exception of NWN) but the fact that this game is based on the newer set of rules didn't bother me much.  It's a computer game after all, the exact mechanics of the system I don't have to understand.  The thing that did bother me about this game is the fact that it was one big battle after another.  Your commanders send you on endless suicide runs.  It got to the point where I could simply leave my game runing for an hour or two while my chacters could hack and slash their way through the tide of randomly spawned criters.It got boring really fast.  Not too mention difficult as well.  The really sad part was, when I read the general plot outline, I was enthusiastic.  I have always wanted to see what would happen if the Orc races banned together in an army and attempted to invade.  But, when you and your 5 companions are the only ones on the front lines against an army... this is the point where (in pen and paper RPG's) that I tell the fellow who is hiring me to shove it
+ War has erupted between humans and an alien life force known as the Gnosis.  Man is in danger if nothing is done soon.  That's where Shion Uzuki, the designer for the Anti-Gnosis Weapons System known as KOS-MOS, comes in.This game has a splendid opening, it really gets you thinking about life itself (the subtitle is also a book written by a philospher).  Anyway, you start out on a space ship that is creating the ultimate weapon against the Gnosis.  However, before completion the Gnosis attack your ship and KOS-MOS starts herself up by herself.From then on, your basically thrown around to different areas, exploring multiple storylines and trying to figure out why everything is happening.The graphics in this game are similar to that of an anime game.  The characters have big googly eyes and look a little cartoonish (especially Shion).  That's what really sets the mood for the game, though.The battle system is really unique and unlike any I have tried.  Basically you have physical or ether (like magic) attacks.  If you choose to guard during a turn the AP gauge will go up, allowing you to do an extra, more powerful combo.  Once you level up a lot, you'll gain more of these powerful end moves that will allow you to defeat stronger enemies.  You're not limited to just the characters, you also have AGWS units, which are basically mechs.I really was not disappointed in this game, I loved it better than any RPG (yes, even FFVII).This a great game for the PS2 collection, I would highly recommend it
+ Hello all, uhh there's not really much to this card...but yeah it keeps you online for another year, which is good, its 50 bucks for the year long which is very cheap so yeah go out and buy this if your online. PS...online people add me my 'tag is Smiling Bob117
- Image if you took all those aspects of an MMORPG that everyone complains about: The lack of story, the constant level griding, the stingy monetary system, the stingy experience system, quests that require the FAQ, and completely stupid party members. That, in a nutshell, is what FFXII is like.It starts out well, though, with strong characters, beautiful graphics, and good playablity. If, the game had stopped at about 30 hours in, it would have shined as a great game. But, 40 MORE hours of grinding and subquests are neccessary past that point, where there's almost no story. In fact, what story there IS gives a strong indication that you shouldn't actually BE doing what the story wants you to do.Truth be told, the game is terrible, when all is said and done, and the rediculous ramping up of difficulty as the game progresses, the absurdity of the License Point system, and the very concept of BUYING AI routines so your party isn't hopelessly stupid (which, they still generally are), completely ruin the experience.Once, the Final Fantasy series was the standout line of console role-playing games. How the mighty have fallen. It's not the worst RPG out on the market, but it's easily the worst of the franchise, and one of the worst of the past couple of years.Play any of the other Final Fantasy games instead, and give this one a complete pass
- Lack of balance...if one thing could be pointed at as the problem, it is the lack of balance.The battle system was a good attempt and it sounded great on paper but it just didn't pan out. As has been mentioned, the number of enemies and the speed of enemies took away from the battle. Also, the monotony of the enemies left me wanting. During one area of the game, in the Sandsea, I had a chain of 164, I wasn't trying to get chain points, either. No matter how good the battle system was designed, 164 of the same enemy, in a row, gets boring.The license system seemed more like a dumbed down version of the sphere grid in FFX. I loved the sphere grid, wasn't so fond of this system. Obtaining the experience through battle to increase your abilities would have made this a success, requiring abilities to also be bought made it a failure. At level 20, Penelope had cleared the Magick section of the grid, although, her highest level magick that was of use was Cura...hardly an impressive skill.The storyline was like riding a snail. Too many cut-scenes and not enough interesting developments. The gil distribution was down-right ridiculous. Leveling up for hours, exploring every nook-and-cranny of a dungeon, and still not having enough money to improve your weapons...there just wasn't a good balance. There needs to be a healthy dose of risk and reward to keep it interesting, in past games, leveling up was just as fun as progressing the story...it felt like a necessary chore in FFXII. For nearly every enemy I remember, you got 1 license point per kill. By a rough estimation, 1800 enemies would need killed to clear one section of the licensing system.The last rant was the character classes, or lack of. Any character can be anything you want and carry any weapon you want (for a necessary price). While the openness can be good, it makes for rather boring characters and the excitement of getting new skills for a class is completely lost. After all, so what if Vaan gets that new axe when Basche is right behind (note: I mentioned a weapon...there are no special abilities unique to any character, either).Between the lack of rewards, gil, ability increases with experience, and monotony of battles, I would not recommend this game. I put 20 hours into the game and completely lost interest midway through a hunt (the mini-games are bland and the rewards for completing a hunt are nothing to get excited about, comparable to defeating a difficult enemy in previous FF games). I believe you can make a decision as to whether you will enjoy this game with a rental. Naturally, another person may like everything I ranted on above. Like any FF game, you hate the learning curve from the previous for a few hours and then become addicted...I lost interest in the middle of the addiction-stage
- I want to take a moment to address the battle system and the license system.  These systems, while well-conceived, have completely ruined the game for me.  For example, the license system is, itself, a very good idea:  It allows the player to craft the character to his liking and tastes.  The problem lies in the execution.   Say, for example you want to learn "Steal." Not only do you have to get the license for it but you also have to purchase it in the game.  This presents problems. In my game, for example, my characters possess a suite of licenses that they cannot use because the shops don't carry that particular item.  The system gives you flexibility but snatches it away by requiring that you not only get the license but to also find the item.   I can't help but to feel hobbled by the license system.  Because these items (which require licenses) come at discrete parts of the game, the developers have cunningly shot up the difficulty.  It doesn't matter that I earned the license for "Shield of Fire" at level 4, I can only get it at level 20+ when its offered in a shop!The game is very challenging precisely because the mechanics prevent characters from getting better-than-normal equipment after they earned the license. The sly, artificial way the developers of FFXII ramped up the difficulty strips away seems almost arbitrary and unnecessary. The cap of three playable characters (at one time) is the straw that breaks the camel's back.Lastly, the battle system, in my opinion, isn't fitting for a console RPG.  It feels like I am playing World of Warcraft or City of Heroes. The enemies are always faster than you.  It's nigh impossible to chase them down and they always are able to catch up with you. Fighting with a bow is an exercise in futility: the enemies will catch you because the game freezes you in place during firing. The R2 button, which allows you to flee, borders between being useless to outright deadly to use. While fleeing, the game prevents you from interacting with objects. So if you flee toward a door, you have to stop, pause, let them hit you, before you can escape.  My mouth gaped open when I saw the reviews for the game online.  This game received astronomical scores, some heralding it as the best Final Fantasy ever.  That shocks me beyond belief.   FFXII would be a better MMORPG and an even sharper two-player RPG.  As a single-player game, with shoddy A.I mechanics, the game plays like a tumbling rock. Perhaps I am just too old school, but this game tastes too much like lollipops and bubblegum.  Your mileage may vary.
+ The price of the card is about $7-$10 cheaper than in the stores, but what is the point if you have to pay $10 shipping (Express) or about $7 (Office Depot), who are the ones that are shipping you this card and not Amazon.  This much to ship a tiny card and thin packaging is a joke. 
- This game looked so crazy I couldn't resist it.  I mean Disney and Squaresoft trying to merge Final Fantasy and a load of Disney cartoons must have seemed like a cool idea in Japan since they love cartoons so much, but in the USA it's just insane.  On top of that you have voice talents from Mandy Moore to Lance Bass, and as production values go you knew you had to be in for one of most ridiculous games in history.   Hardcore fans were bothered that this looked like a kids' game but aren't games supposed to be aimed at children and teens anyway?I was ultimately disappointed with Kingdom Hearts.  The world and characters of Kingdom Hearts is not really about a Final Fantasy Disney crossover it's just a place for the kids you control to have out their little melodrama.  It's like the idea of Disney meets Final Fantasy just takes a back seat.  Once you get past all the hype Kingdom Hearts is boring and frustrating.  A nagging issue is the tiny areas in this game.  "Planet Alice in Wonderland" consists of four small rooms of course you will spend a great deal of time in them fighting off monsters.  The combat is a blend of chaotic button mashing and watching your party members act like total fools until they die.  The worst of it is respawning monsters, you can't take a step without having to fight and re-fight hoards of shadow munchkins that you had just defeated.  Because of this you'll spend the majority of your money on healing items.  Bosses are a nightmare since they are hard to survive and take forever to kill (30 minutes is normal.)  Since combat is so simple it really makes the drawn out battles beyond boring.  After beating 2 bosses I was done with this game.  I know that Kingdom Hearts 2, Mushashi Samurai Legend, and Final Fantasy 13 all have the same combat woes.  I wish Squaresoft would learn that respawning enemies and bosses with 9 million hit points are a thing of the past
+ This site is the cheapest I have found for this card.Do not pay for your live service monthly on your credit card.It's alot cheaper to buy one of these cards every year
+ Nintendo has dominated the handheld industry since the GameBoy came out. Now that Sony has stepped in, some predicted that their hold might finally be breaking. Not so, and there is no better proof than the DS Lite.The Lite is an evolutionary step over the original DS, similar to the GameBoy Advance SP. It has a more compact form factor, brighter screens, a side-mounted power button, weighs less, has longer battery life, and simply looks more fashionable. The basic functionality of the DS is still here- same buttons and general button layout, wi-fi, GBA compatibility, etc.Is this worth buying if you already have a DS? Maybe, if you've got some spare cash. Is this worth buying if you don't own a DS? Definitely. The design is far superior to the old DS.No DS review would be complete without further mention of the PSP. While the PSP is undoubtedly a more capable device, it has significant weaknesses compared to the DS. Particularly, PSP games tend to have far longer load times, it has much shorter battery life, and the hardware itself is more fragile. Oh, and of course, there's the cost. The most critical factor, however, is the library of games available. As of now, DS games are more and better, and there's simply no contest when it comes to which has more to offer in this department. Games are what really make or break a console, and the wide variety of excellent casual and immersive DS titles make it a clearcut winner.
+ While I only own one game for the DS, what makes it so great is the wifi ability to play with friends. I have spent a couple afternoons at a friend's house with several other people, all playing Mario Kart against each other, and it was a fun time full of excitement with people yelling, for either being knocked back from 1st to dead last, or managing to squeeze out the win at the last second.The touch screen is also a great addition to the DS. Some games allow either the touch screen or the standard controls to be used, depending on preference. Others, like Mario Kart, stick to the standard controls, and others require the use of just the touch screen, creating a very unique kind of game.The Lite is also an improvement of the first DS. While it may not be worth it to upgrade if you already have the first DS, it is worth it if it will be your only DS. The Lite is better shaped, has a better battery life, and better, brighter screens. The DS Lite certainly is a great handheld console
- Now, before you say anything, I have played this game and beaten it in the week provided by blockbuster(grudgingly playing it though)and now for the unbaiased opinion. I think that this game is so completely stupid. It and the sequel are retarded but again its my opinion.
- I really could not tell you anything, as I still have not recieved this game, despite having paid for it over a month and a half ago
- Please promise me you will never play this.  It is not worth your time.  If you paid money for it, try to find the person you gave that money to and kick them in the shin.  Hard.  Then throw your copy of this game in the dumpster.Seriously though, this game is absolutely terrible.  The graphics are bad even for the PSX, the combat quickly becomes boring as all hell, the story line was confused and the fact that there was a second dimension pointless.  There was no reason for there being 40 something characters, most of them were exactly the same statwise, and all of them were poorly designed.  The most annoying thing in the world, bar nothing, is having to re-equip all your character's spells whenever you switch characters.  You have like 50 spell slots.  God.  I don't think I even need to say it, but those crumbums at Square couldn't pull another hit out of their oversized victorian tophats if they wanted too.  They should really stick with straight to video Final Fantasy 7 anime movies from now on, lest they risk making something like this again
+ At the time, white was the only option.  Red would have pleased my child more.  I've found SP games which claim to work with the wireless attachement, do NOT work (communicate) with DS games.  But as for the DS Lite, its a reasonable size, perhaps slightly larger buttons would be nicer.  Now they offer Pink and Black, which is nice, but exchangable covers would have been nice.  The stylus is just barely managable for Adult hands but work fine for my child.  The screens are bright and no longer dimmable (backlighting could be turned off in the SP.  One nice feature is many games allow some amout of co-play with another DS, even if your partner doesn't have a copy.  Stores like "GameStop" often have kiosks that allow you to download demos of different games.  Thats nice but you cannot keep the demo thru a power cycle, so that's a bummer.  The biggest pain yet is I have not found a cable to communicate between the DS Lite and the SP (one does exist for the DS to SP).  Oh, an the power supply cable is different as well.  So, while less bulky and better layout, the DS Lite steps you even further away from the accessories which worked between SP and DS (first versions, not Lite).  Such is the proprietary way.  I'd really like to see more adult software for these things.  They are not far from a PDA with their audio recognition and handwriting as well
- The first game we played on Gamecube was Spongebob, Battle for Bikini Bottom.  We absolutely loved it and my daughter plays it over and over.  Thinking Shrek 2 would be similar, we rented it.  It's very hard to control the c-stick and it kept zooming in and out and wouldn't rotate the camera except for certain times.  The charactors were very distant and even if we used the c-stick to zoom in, it still wasn't close enough.  It's the same feeling as needing to put eyeglasses on to see something more clearly! Another aspect we didn't like was the four charactors are always together and you would lose track of which one was the main charactor.  Maybe we're spoiled because the c-stick on Spongebob allowed you to rotate in every direction to see what was around you and the graphics were so good you could see facial expressions.  It's surprising all the reviews are so good because our impression was completely opposite. 
- I loved "The Incredibles," so I was excited to play the game.  I've only been playing video games the last couple years, and only off and on, so I'm really just a beginner.  Perhaps that explains the enormous difficulty I've had with this game.  My boyfriend is a long-time video game player, and he was able to do things in one or two tries that I labored for hours over.  Even using cheat codes did not really help me all that much.  I was surprised when I read the review that said the game was too easy.  I almost cried.  LOL  But seriously, unless you are a good gamer, you're probably going to be more frustrated than challenged by this game.  As for me, I guess I'll stick to action RPGs
+ I had a chance to buy this game machine for my 10yr old boy with super mario. Two monitors are bright enough to play with even under the sun light and battery runs long enough at least almost all day long after they came back from school till they go to bed as  long as  you do full charge during the night. I was a "game watch"-"gameboy"-"PSP" player but once you start to use this machine, you will instantly understand why this game machine became mega-hit  machine, EASILY.I am planning to purchase another one for my younger daughter to let them enjoy communication system with 2 machines.
-   hi- it was impossible to use this product because the key they gave me didn't work. I might make a fisbee out of the DVD!                                              jerr
+ I bought it coz I always wanted something like this, after I got it I just went and bought a game, I made the little mistake to ask who I am living with that said "I don't like games" which one should I buy, well we picked animal crossing and the machine and the games are so good that I havent been able to play it too often It was taken away from me hehehehehSo my review is his and he sais that it deserves FIVE STAR
- Bought this Platinum game with much anticipation and it doesn't work at all.  Tried the download .exe patch and does nothing and to top it off half the original game forum sites crash too.  No one has any idea how to fix this game and all you have to do is look at the dozen of patches out on first game.  If they had spent the time and money to build the game and test it right like Blizzard does and companies like Westwood was then they would release a finished game but decided to use everyone as gunea pigs to test the product so they could try to patch it to work.DO NOT BUY ANYTHING from this company or its affiliates I think they are Alkida implants trying to take over the western world. If you want to play a game with style then wait until June and get "Titan's Quest" which should be finally a Diablo 3.   Too bad this company couldn't find the capital to complete the game before release and would think anyone wanting to buy Spellforce 2 should be warned upfront to make sure you wait for about 6 months after release and buy an additional hard drive so you can download the new Patch fixes they will probably try to smoke screen you with as they count their money and send it to Iran
+ This is the best working and cheapest cheating device for the PS2. For all you adults who think that the memery card corruption is permanant, well, do some research! I can figure out a way to solve the problem, and I'm only 13! You are all over 21! AR Max Memory has a formatting feature, which scrapes all of the corrupted data away. Yes, you will lose your hard-earned saves, but that's the price for cheating. Who ever said that cheating would be fair? Overall, besides the Max Memory portion, this item is great
+ There are just so many different ways you can add a cheat into a game, and beat the game. You can either try the hard way through practice, or you can access and enter a cheat code that was created by the compant that created the game, or you can just enhance it. Thanks to the people at Datel, you can definitely punch in those codes with the Action Replay Max for the Playstation 2. It is simple and easy to operate. There are also sveral different codes that are preloaded for so many excititng games like Madden '06, Jak and Daxter, or Need For Speed: Underground 2. This is an absolute delight for anybody who owns a Playstation 2, and for anybody who definitely wants a shortcut to beating the game.Price: B+Convience: B 1/2+Overall: B
- I have a pretty decent computer (Athlon64/3000+, Radeon X550), but this game does not work at all.  Even after I download and install the patch from Aspyr (though there is no excuse for the game to not at least load straight out of the box), spellforce.exe just sits there and sucks up 99% of the CPU until I kill the process.  Aspyr support is unable to help.That said, despite other reviews here, this game does NOT install Starforce.  But maybe that's why my version won't work..
+ I liked this game. I mean Final Fantasy VII is still the god final fantasy game but this was ok. I mean it also comes with chrono trigger. if you have played chrono cross and got confused that means you never played trigger.
+ This collection isn't as bonus feature happy as Anthology was. this version of FF4 (2 in the USA at the time of the SNES/Genesis era) hasn't changed that much. the random battle loading screen is like the SNES version, the switch between field/world map to the character menu while loading is fast as hell (while sadly Chrono Trigger is slower than the 2 FF games for the Anthology collection and even slower than the other Final Fantasy games for the PSone Era (7,8,9)) Chrono Trigger has a lot of bonus features for this version. Squaresoft (at the time) put a S*** load of cinemas (mainly ending cinemas), has a list of music from the game, and other stuff. The game-play is still the same, with the exception of what I said earlier, which is good otherwise. unlike Anthology, this collection has no bonus music CD (for those who care anyway). this is still worth owning anyway
+ This is a really nice remake of a great classic (FFIV).  They improved the dialogue, and added in a lot of great items.  The challenge level, however, was bumped up significantly.  The game was originally paced so you didn't have to spend nearly as much time leveling up.  A few of the bosses surprised me this time through (I've played the SNES version multiple times in my day).  The story is unchanged, however.  A must have for any FF/Classic RPG fan!  As a bonus, I finally got to play Chrono Trigger
+ This is a good collection. It's even better if you have a PS1 emulator and a fast PC. This would cut down on the lag. (Of course, if you have such, other options arise.)Some have mentioned the lag issue. As one who played through these on the SNES, I can assure you there is horrid lag. The PS2 has a faster CD drive and some form of caching for PS1 titles which helps dramatically, but by no means removes the delay.In Chrono Trigger on the console, fights started with no discernable lag. The creatures on the background jump out at you and you're fighting with no visible delay beyond the jumping animation.(or whatever they do) In FF2/4 the screen did fade black, and then faded in, but this took about an eighth to quarter of a second. (estimated)Chrono Trigger was a great game. The story is fun, and the characters are great. The story is non-linear and you get a great feeling of control. How many games give you the choice of killing off one of the bosses or accepting their help? (Your choice affects the ending in a reasonable fashion)FF2 (4) was also a great story. When I played through it first, I commented how it felt like playing through a book. Much less choice in progression than even in earlier FF's, though. Fun, regardless.Finally, he sound quality was lower on the PS version than on the original console. The fade effects on the music and such are gone. I haven't played through sufficiently to notice any other changes, but that one was rather glaring. I really liked the use of fadeing to make it sound like you were getting away from the source. (Such as the Millineal Fair music fading as one wanders away from town.) The PS version rather ungraciously terminates at some distance, and then at some further distance fires up the new music. Jarring.The original Chrono Trigger would get 5/5, but these issues particularly hinder it.
+ This disc set contains two spectacular games, Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger. Both of the games are wonderful. I have played every version of Final Fantasy IV, the Japanese version fan translated, the English version on the SNES and the remade version on the PSX. I loved all three versions. Final Fantasy IV's storyline is great. The plot starts right away. The storylien is gripping and it makes you feel a lot of symphathy for the characters. All of the characters have well developed personalities and this game has a quest for redemotion It shows that people can change. When Cecil is in a situation where he must choose honor and dignity versus the life he knew- he makes a decision that will change his life forever. He goes against everything he learned to do the right thing, what his conscience tells him and embarks on a quest for redemption. When he becomes a new person, the other characters are developed, and his relationship with his lover and his companions are delved into. The storyline is great- a wonderful love story and a great tale
- I gave it one star because there was no way to give it less.This game when played on the X Box was great.  So when it came out for PC I bought it.  BIG MISTAKE!  The control are too hard to learn.  And when you are in a battle you can't stop to think which keys when used together work. There are too many keys that you need to push together to do even the simplest thing.   I wasted my money on this game.  I deleted it and will never play it.  Don't waste your money
+ On November 15, Nyko states:"Nyko is proud to announce that they've shipped more than 500,000 Intercooler 360s to date, helping consumers lengthen the lives of their Xbox 360s so they get more from their investment in next-generation hardware. The Intercooler 360 creates superior airflow which reduces the console's internal temperatures. By maintaining better performance temperature throughout the Xbox 360 system, the Intercooler 360 ultimately prolongs the life of the hardware which would otherwise be affected by the intense internal temperatures inside the console. Recently, a story appeared online claiming that the Intercooler 360 is damaging Xbox 360 consoles. Although it looks as if the story came from an isolated incident, NYKO takes any such claims seriously. It is possible that a defective unit caused damage in the incident, however it is impossible to confirm this is the case without inspecting the unit first hand and performing tests on the hardware. Any number of reasons from a power spike, to using the Xbox 360 without a surge protector could have caused damage.Nyko stands by its products 100% and is confident in the Intercooler 360 and its reliability as a safe and effective means of lengthening the life of the Xbox 360 console.While a small percentage of all products suffer from defects, the total defect rate for the Intercooler 360 is well under 1%, which is less than half of the average for consumer electronics products. All consumer products will suffer from a small number of defects, and Nyko is extremely proud of the low defect rates for the Intercooler 360. For those consumers who feel they have received a defective product, Nyko will replace both the damaged Intercooler 360 and Xbox 360 console upon first hand verification that the Intercooler 360 caused the system to fail." 
+ In the persuit of keeping you 360 cool it does the job quite well. But as a side affect it is quite loud which may detur someone from using it
+ Introduction:I've had this intercooler since it was released last spring, and it has worked well and done its job.  My 360 is on for at least 3 days at a time with and without a game running.  Here is the latest update from IGN regarding the Intercooler.Here are some facts:1.  Scorch Marks?  This device was a hassle to make sure it was properly and securely plugged in all the way.  If you move your 360 a lot, the cable can losen VERY easily.  The "snap" on of the power cord holds the power cord, but it doesn't make sure it is plugged in straight or not at a slight angle.  You can try this out yourself: move your power cable around, you will see that if you have a habit of moving the 360 around and not recheck the connect in the back, it CAN be moved slightly to an angle.  What would this do?  It would most certainly cause major power issues.  You know how the end of the powercord looks like; with all the holes that pins on the other end need to connect to, you can't afford to not constantly make sure your cord connecting to the Intercooler is nice, tight, and secure.2. Loud noise?  I have a lot of old PCs in the house, and if I ever do turn them off, turning them back on would cause temporary loud noise coming from the fan.  This is due to dust and the ball bearings either wearing out or starting up with dust in the way.  Is this a problem?  No, because my Intercooler currently starts up with a louder than usual noise, but like my PC fans, the noise stops within a seconds to a minute and everything is back to normal.3.  How loud is the Intercooler when it is brand new?  I DON'T even notice it.  My xbox1 makes more noise than the xbox360 + intercooler.  Moreover, when you're playing a game with the volume on, you will forget you even have an Intercooler running.4. Stealing power from 360?  This is rediculous.  What do you think the controllers and USB devices are doing when you plug them into the 360?  Supplying power?  Yeah right.  These tiny fans use less power than plugging in your ipod or whatever usb device and controllers.  It's true that microsoft has not publicly recommended this product, but neither would microsoft allow a product that would damage their expensive consoles.  It's Microsoft who has to pay for the repairs, shipping, and replacement of these consoles.  Microsoft would NOT allow a third party to develop hardware that would break the 360 100% of the time.5.  What is this 100% of the time thing I just typed?  I do know for a fact that there are lots of faulty intercoolers.  I've read about lots of exchanges on intercoolers, actually, my first intercooler never worked.  It never turned on.  I took it back on the same day and everything has been fine since.  If you have a problem with it, don't wait or let your Intercooler continue to run.  Just take it back and get a new one.  It's onmly 20 bux, the thing is made of plastic, what do you expect?  It does, however, do its job.  I have never had my 360 lockup, overheat, or any kind of problems.  I have an xbox from the second wave/shipment in december, and it is on ALL THE TIME!Recommendations:PLEASE, don't have your 360 standing up.  That is just about the dumbest thing Microsoft could have suggested.  Take a look at your 360 and tell me where the largest and majority of the vents are?  EXACTLY, they are on the bottomside where you would stand your 360 up.  The Nyko works better if those vents are not blocked.  It is EXTRACTING air, and thus need more air to pass through.  Even if you don't use an Intercooler, please, don't stand that thing up.  I've read more problems about overheating and disc scratching due to verticle 360's.  How does it scratch discs?  Think about it, when it is released from the drive, how does the disc stand straight up?  It is just released and it drops down to the slot that holds the disc, and it doesn't hold it in a perfectly level or straight up position that would allow the overly sensitive drive to pick the disc back up at the right angle.
+ There aren't many games now-a-days that can get me interested enough to play regularly, but Dominions 2 is one that definitely does.It's a multi-player, multi-platform (Mac, Windows, Linux), turn-based strategy game. There is a tun of different strategies to go with, many nations, magic items, spells, different units. Excellent game for a hardcore strategy person.The only drawback is the interface. It's certainly not perfect and takes a bit to get used to. But there is lots of documentation online to help with that kind of stuff.I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good multi-player turn-based strategy. It's the best I've ever played (and I've played quite a few
+ Dominions 2 is a fantastic leap into TBS on an Epic scale. Huge Gods battling for supremacy by any means possible. Genocide, reckless magic, and disregard for humanity to be the last god of the panthenon.  A steep learning curve, especially for perfectionists it provides you with a simulation of fantasty combat as opposed to actual historical combat.  Low end graphics are balanced with the fact there are so many of them along with additional abilities.  A must for those who love 4X and TBS games. Not for everyone and documentation that does not do the game justice, it is hard to get into, but if you can get past the "I'm LOSING and I don't know why!" feeling, you will be well worth it
+ I emphasize strategy. What you will not find are fancy graphics, studio sound, arcade action, cheats, or a killer strategy that will win every time. This game is wonderfully balanced with 17 nations (another in the works), 1100 units, 400 spells, 400 magic sites, 250 magic items, and much more. But the neat thing is that they give you what you need to play in YOUR style. Berserker, defensive, researcher, swarmer, sneak, diplomatic, whatever. Instead of feeling like you are learning the strategies that the developer had in mind for you to learn, you can actually develop your OWN tactics and surprises. There are people who have played it over a year and still come up with new things to try. (and yes, its one of those games which will ACTUALLY survive on your machine for a year
+ My friend told me it was unbelivably fun and said if u like a good laugh It`s a MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- this game is just the original + a crappy beam system where you spin to the right when you lock beams and the gamplay is totally repetitive also their isnt any in game transforming at ALL!! I hate this game so MUCH!! it is literally the worst DBZ game I have ever played {and I have played them all) I advise you if ur looking for a new DBZ game wait for the next one because their shure isnt anything new here but a crappy beam system. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME EVER!!!!
- Have you played any of the games in the Doom series?  How about Metroid Prime? Medal of Honor? Golden Eye?  Well, then you've played Halo 2, also, because ALL First Person Shooter games are exactly the same.  I don't care how many times X-Box magazine (odd how the magazine that drools the most over an X-BOX game is the system's magazine.) calls it the greatest game of all time, I'd rather play Mario Power Tennis which was atrocious.The story is absolutely appauling in terms of a Science Fiction orientated theme, utterly mundane, unoriginal, boring and just all around unentertaining.  The game-play is so generic that it's as if this was the first creation of some fresh out of college video game designer, the music is cliche, the voice acting is flat, and Master Chief is just an all around retard.The weapons, oh boy, the weapons, again another lame aspect of the game.  The alien's weapons are like something in the kid's "toy gun" section from Toys R Us, and the human guns are nothing that I haven't used in a Resident Evil game.When the first Halo came out I didn't get the big deal, I didn't even play it, then eventually I got myself an X-Box, and decided to give this installment a shot - huge mistake.  Come to think of it none of the games of X-box are even worth owning a system for: Fable was decent, but got old after beating it a few times, The Knights of the Old Republic series was boring, and everything else on X-Box I could play on PS2 or Gamecube
- Halo 1 on steroids, Halo 2 is a clear Microsoft stamp on Bungie's creativity and control and it muddies up what was a balanced game-play.  A hackneyed single player story that makes no sense, and has no flow, along with levels that aren't replayable.  You thought the Library from Halo1 was tedious?  Try the headache inducing map design in this game.  Also in the nonsense, the unneccesary switch to an Elite's perspective for half the game, along with a new group of Covenant bad guys that look like rejects from a Captain Planet cartoon.  Apes with mohawks, yeah, nice design.  I can only play one or two levels of the single player, and they are so noobish, it loses appeal quickly. On to Multi-Player.  Okay, in 2004 upon release, this was a great game.  It took time to go up in level, and the ranking system wasn't as abused as it is now.  Once new maps, kept on the harddrive (read mod kids) were released by Bungie, that opened the door to full blown chaos.  Now 2 years later, modding has died down somewhat, but a whole new slew of bridging and connection speed manipulation makes it roughly 25% likely you'll find a game with no lag.  So I still play on occasion, it's lame they can't offer dedicated servers so you can play your map of choice, choose servers with good connections, and then the modders and big gun noobs can find the type of game they want to play too.  I only pray Halo 3's multi-player improves on this system, otherwise I'm done with the Xbox console permanently
+ This WiiPoints card, which is the equivalent of $20, allows one to purchase and download games from the Wii's virtual console, part of the Wii Shop channel. Already, at launch, 12 games throughout the history of gaming were available, including Pinball (Nintendo Entertainment System), Sonic the Hedgehog (Sega Genesis), SimCity (Super Nintendo Entertainment System), and Super Mario 64 (Nintendo 64). Nintendo is planning to add new games every Monday, to come to a total of 30 by the end of the year. Beyond that, "new classics" are coming throughout 2007 such as Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars (Super Nintendo), and Mario Kart 64 (Nintendo 64). Many of these games can be controlled with the included Wii Remote or the backwards-compatible GameCube controllers. Some require the Wii Classic Controller, but a great number use the other two aforementioned control methods
+ The e-Reader is one of the best things that happened to Nintendos GBA. this is so SWEA
+ This is great even if you have the NES games. For one you can bring it anywhere and it doesn't have 2 player mode. It IS compatible with GBA SP because it does not require the game link port on the SP. The only flaw is you need to scan 10 cards to play one NES game and you can only save one at a time. Still, that won't stop you cuz when you get proficient at swiping them, its nothing. But the e-Reader does more than NES games; you may play e-Readers from Nintendo Magazines, you can play Game and Watch games, look at Pokemon (who cares about that feature???), connect to games like Super Mario Bros. 3 and get power-ups as well as new levels, and hook up to a Gamecube for double experience. The only problem is to connect to games you need 2 Game Boys and a link cable but that it isn't too much of a problem. Also, e-Reader packs are fairly cheap even in New York City. Gameplay and graphics are faithful to the originals, too
- There is nothing majorly wrong with this game.  The plot is well-developed, the characters are customizable, and the battles are strategic.  This is probably primarily subjective, but I just didn't enjoy this game.  It's not because there were too many movies--it's because I didn't like the movie.  I also didn't like the characters or the villains or for that matter the aesthetics.  There were some minor but annoying flaws in the game which further contributed to my displeasure.  Which button to press was often counterintuitive, and so I often found myself pressing the wrong button.  Also, the game badly needs a journal and/or a destination guide so you know where to go--I once spent one hour doing nothing other than walking around a space ship trying to figure out where to go
- This is by far the worst instance of overzealous copy protection I've ever experienced.  I bought this game new at a local store because I've been itching to play SimCity 4 but that game will not work with my new video card.  Got this game home and it installed just fine, but when it came time to launch the game, it said disc authentication failed.  Tried it with the other disc, failed again.  Went to the company's support forums and found a lot of other people with the same problem and no one had done anything to help them.  Thankfully the people at the store were very reasonable and gave me a full refund
- Don't buy it unless you want the Starforce malware on your computer.  I understand publishers wanting to prevent piracy, but not at the expense of replacing the drivers I need(ed) for my DVD burner.  Check the search engines and see for yourself.  Would have otherwise been a great game, too bad it isn't playable because of this malware
- Starforce....nothing else need be said. Starforce singlehandly has destroyed a number of "could be" great games...I don't know since not a single one will play on a Dell XPS "Gaming" Laptop
- I bought this game because it sounded like a lot of fun.  I tried installing it on my Dell laptop and no dice.  It would not run.  I tried installing it on my Dell desktop computer and again, it would not run.  When I went to the knowledge base, technical support lists that if you have an integrated video card, the game will not work on your system.  In short, if you have an "over the counter" system, you cannot run this game on your computer.  I find this ridiculous and disappointing.  I would not suggest buying this game until you go to their technical support page and go over all of the requirements for game play.  Especially since these little facts are not listed on the box
+ Anyone who has ever played the original would know that the whole point of kingdom hearts is to beat the stuffing out of the heartless with nifty weapons known as keyblades,  Well, this time around you get to beat the stuffing out of heartless and a new brand of villan known as nobody's.  With a compelling story line and great voice acting, donald and goofy act and sound just like their dsney versions, kingdom hearts 2 delivers in every aspect of game-play except for one, the summons.  I love this game, don't get me wrong, but I felt that they really could have added a couple of more summons into the mix to make the battle system that much more fun, the original had roughly 7 summons all together and this one has only 4.  Square, how about adding a couple of final fantasy summons, into the game-play?  *cough, cough* BEHEMUT!  Either way this is a great game, one that any final fantasy or disney fan should pick up
+ If you liked the original then you will also like KH2. It finishes the story nicely. Battle commands are improved - I especially like the Reaction commands. Still has some camera issues. Overall a good game
- This game sucks.  It tries to be Sim City with extra features.  Unfortunately, the graphics are way below average.  In fact, some of the screens look like they were designed by a first year art student.  The Interface is clumsy and not intuitive.  I am a big fan of the Sim City series and this game really falls short
+ If you liked the first KH you will like this one. 
+ So, if it's such an excellent game, why 4 stars on "fun" rating?Well, it's a very very fun game, but some parts can get annoying and aggravating. And it seems as if the different levels of difficulty are achieved by handing you less and less health upgrades, which is kinda cheap, if you ask me. They physically limit you, instead of strategicly doing so.But everything else is great about it. Graphics are great, not excellent, but great. Sound is great too. Gameplay is excellent and the story is very well developed. Kinda on the easy side in normal level, though. But, I guess nothing is perfect.Go ahead and get this one. It's worth what it costs
+ The end of the "Sands of Time" trilogy marks a successful return to the style and fun of Prince of Persia - Sands of Time. The Two Thrones combines the good fighting mechanics of Warrior Within (WW) with the downright utter enjoyment that the Sands of Time (SoT) started two years ago.The story picks up where WW left off, with the Prince returning home to Babylon. Before you know it, the sands of time make a comeback and the Prince is left in peril in order to save his kingdom. All the great platforming tasks of insane jumps and crazy obstacles are here, as are most of the "sand powers" found in the first two iterations.Gameplay is the same for the most part. The new "speed kill" system is quite fun, but some may find it eases the fighting difficulty quite a bit. That being said, its not always the easiest thing to pull off, especially when multiple enemies are involved, but a cool addition none the less.The graphics look better than ever, a slight improvement over WW, and a remarkable improvement over Sot which was jaw dropping only two years ago. The rendered cut-scenes look good and the sound is clear, including all the voice acting where the original actor from SoT has returned to voice the Prince. He does a great job again and really adds to the overall quality of the game. The music is a return to the orchestral sounds of eastern decent, and the hard rock has left the building to much acclaim. This game is very linear, which some people may stray away from. There is no multiple back tracking like WW. However it is enjoyable from start to finish. Even the new chariot races are interesting, but some may find them slightly out of place. There is one Boss fight in-particular that will cause many frustrating moments to all. After a few times (or perhaps dozens) studying the patterns and getting your attack down, it becomes no problem.I did experience one glitch that caused my game to freeze at a certain point several times. After searching around on message boards, it seems to be a common problem. I was able to get past it after resaving over the save point file. A word of advice - have at least a few different save files along the journey so you don't have to start over at anytime.The ending is completely appropriate to the trilogy, and leaves you hoping the Prince will one day return. This game is a little on the short side. At around 7-8 hours for me to complete, it seemed shorter than the previous two. All in all, a great game. A must play for anyone who enjoyed the previous two, or for fans of third-person action adventure. You owe it to yourself to play the first two beforehand though, if only to see the story from beginning to end, and to experience one epic adventure
- This game has StarForce copy protection, which is software that you do not want on your computer. Reportedly, it replaces your CD and/or DVD drivers, and often causes extreme hardware and software problems. I've been a victim of the software problems, it basically crippled my very expensive SCSI scanners and it was extremely difficult to figure out what was doing it. It could be the best game that's ever been produced, but anyone who's had the StarForce experience is going to steer clear
- I actually recieved this from a friend of mine, which he bought for $0.98. Anyway, I said that there were television shows that I thought were interesting, but were only sold over in the UK (and so on). He told me that the AR MAX was a REGION X DVD reader. So, I took it home, and decided on buying a TV series that was a Region 2, and just recieved it today, to my surprise (not actually) the damn thing didn't work. Now I'm stuck with a Region 2 DVD with nothing to play it in. I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT! If you are buying this for the reason that it reads other Regions of DVD's...DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! It is junk. However, I am thankful that I didn't even buy this product, but it was given to me. I hope that someone planning on buying this, reads my review first. IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY
- I have found only one game out of the many that I have tried that the codes on this thing actually work on.  This action replay is basically a twenty dollar or more waste of plastic and the cardboard that it came in.  avoid like the plague
+ The third installment since the rebirth of the classic series and presumably the final chapter in the "Sands of Time" saga, "The Two Thrones" takes the best elements of "The Sands of Time" (game one) and "Warrior Within" (its sequel) and caps the franchise with style, finesse, and game-play as sharp as a scimitar blade.You once again assume the mantle of the nameless Prince of Persia. Returning home to Babylon at long last to find it in ruins and its people at war with an army of sand monsters, the Prince also finds himself in the company of old friends... and old enemies. Cursed, he comes to find his body and soul split in two, and periodically his wicked self, known as the Dark Prince, rises forth to wreak havoc and take control of the Prince's body. The storyline is entertaining, its characters more developed than in most video games, and it strikes a nice balance between darkness and light-heartedness... something "Warrior Within" failed to achieve. In essence, it's what you would get if you took the tone and presentation of games one and two and rolled them together. As mentioned before, the game-play is not far from that either. While "The Sands of Time" set the tone with its acrobatic platforming, which remains pretty much in tact, "Warrior Within" took that game's weak combat mechanics and fleshed them out into something a little more interesting. Happily, both elements are retained and improved upon in this new installment. What's more, "Tenchu"-like stealth kills are now available. While they're far from perfectly executed (sometimes they seem unresponsive), they nonetheless offer a fresh twist and the opportunity to avoid hand-to-hand combat in many circumstances.The Dark Prince is another significant addition. Regularly, throughout the course of the game, the Prince transforms into this alter-ego - a sand monster version of himself that is able to use a weapon called the Daggertail. This weapon functions much like the Belmont whip in a "Castelvania" game, allowing the Dark Prince to attack his enemies and also swing from poles and light fixtures to access new areas the Prince couldn't hope to reach. While stronger than the Prince in combat, unfortunately for the Dark Prince he must sustain himself with a constant supply of sand power or succumb to death when it's all been used up. That makes these portions of the game more intense, and, on rare occasions, a little more frustrating. Also new to the series are the chariot trials, sequences during which the Prince must escape via horse-drawn wagons through hazardous environments at full speed ahead. While they provide a nice change of pace when they do actually occur, they are relatively few and the trial and error nature of them can lead to irritation. There are only a few glaring flaws in "Thrones." The sound effects and ambient music retain their inconsistent, buggy feel. Too often the dialogue sputters and repeats like a broken record, and the music kind of fades in and departs with little rhyme or reason. As well, the graphics suffer from some pretty blatant clipping problems. The engine has aged pretty gracefully, but it has aged - at least the character designs and architecture go a long way keep you distracted from the occasional failings of the visuals. "Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones" is, in many respects, a very similar game to the two that have come before it. Therefore it's not as novel as the first game to longtime followers, but it doesn't feel as long in the tooth as it might have at this stage thanks to the new game-play additions and an entertaining continuation of the story. It's certainly a better game than "Warrior Within," more welcoming in almost every way. This series has a lot of life in it, and "The Two Thrones" is well worth your time and effort.  
+ This is my first experience with Sim City.  I've never played with the earlier versions.  Important Note:  The computer prompts you to type in the code that is in the white box in the lower left part of back of the CD case.  Well, I looked and looked, and it wasn't where the prompt said it would be.  After five minutes of thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me, I finally found the code.  It's on the back of the owners manual located inside the CD case.  You'll find it at the very top of that back cover of the manual, not in the lower left corner.The tutorials are helpful, so if you're new to all of this I highly recommend you go through those first.  And if you feel you need to go through them again, you can reset the tutorials to start fresh all over.I'll built a small city, and I've only had this game for a day, but I know I'm going to love it.
+ Computer games have a bad reputation:  They're violent, mindless, escapist, blah, blah, blah.  Mostly, that reputation is well-deserved; computer games are entertainment, and, as such, they're designed to take our minds off of the "real" world for a while.  What's wrong with that?SimCity 4 is not a typical computer game.  You need no coordination at all, you don't need to accept any fantasy world, there's no one to shoot at (or anything to shoot with, either), there are no mazes to run, and so on.  What there is is an ability to see the "real" world, but in a way you WANT it to be, rather than as it is.In one form or another, SimCity has been around for many years.  This version is part of its continual evolution.  I've owned two earlier versions, and I found this one to be the best yet in terms of features and operation.  It works the way its supposed to.  A side benefit to SimCity is that its long history has allowed a huge on-line community to develop.  There are hundreds of sites offering chat, help with issues, templates for cities, etc.  You certainly don't need these sites to make full use of the game out of the box, but they are there.One of the most interesting things about SimCity is the way it demonstrates that education and entertainment aren't mutually exclusive.  As you play, you are forced to come to terms with issues like the relationship between tax rates and business growth; parks, citizen satisfaction, and public works budgets; pollution and economic development; etc.  However, none of these lessons is explicit; they just dawn on you as you play, because you see the consequences of your decisions.  I have heard that very young kids understand and appreciate these issues after a short time playing.I tend to measure entertainment value in terms of fun per unit of money.  In that regard, SimCity 4 is an outstanding entertainment value.  I've liked the past iterations of the game, I like this one even better, and I'll almost certainly buy the next version, too
- AVOID THIS PRODUCT, wait till PS3 with it's Hard drive an hope something better will come out.Memory cards are flash memory an flash memory is FRAGILE, one whoops an it's destroyed.Damn to hell Sony for making us pop 25 bucks a memory card in the first place.BAD:STAY AWAY FROM MAX MEMORY MANAGER... DO NOT LOAD GAME SAVES FROM THE INTERNET ONTO YOUR MEMORY CARDS. IT WILL CORRUPT AN DESTROY YOUR MEMORY CARD/CARDS. One memory card is worth more than this stupid thing. I lost two memory cards an ALL my bazillion hours of game-play. ALSO... the disc sucks, when the PS2 is warm, it won't recognize the discandif you break or mess the disc up, no way you can make a copy of it an use that. Your screwed!GOOD:The codes work an it's great to whip through a game that was driving you nuts or stressing you out before.If you have complaints, call Datels US office(727) 431-065
+ For those that have have played similar games like Sim City before, this one was great! I have played Sim City 2000, but that was years ago. I had found that game addicting. Now, years later, when I ordered Sim City 4: Deluxe Edition, I was blown away! This game is much better than 2000 could hope to be. They have resolved many of the issues that I had with the older game and then some. I have found this game to be addicting to, and have started different cities at the same time. I am working on getting the "perfect city" for me to be happy with. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of any of the Sim games. I could even say at times it was funny even to read the tongue-in-cheek sayings that come up just as you are starting up the game for the day like "Bureaucratizing Bureaucracies". It was not so much hilarious but, it can help you get in the "fun mode" to play the game. The advisors can get slightly annoying after awhile, especially when you have a different idea about what you want to see in your city than they do, but it is still overall a very entertaining game. My next purchase will most likely be Sims 2, for more of the Sims experience
- FROM AMAZON.CA---------The Action Replay MAX is more than just a video game enhancer (VGE)....or at least it claims to be. My version is quite old yet but it claims to include a Region-free DVD player and a memory card compression utility (squeeze more saves onto your memory card). I have not used either of these features personally, but I have heard horror stories about the memory manager corrupting gamesaves and whole memory cards; some reusable, some permanently damaged. This and the fact that you must load up the action replay software to access saves that use the memory manager turned me off of using it. However, the real reason I bought the ARMax was for its codes and I'll get to those in a second.The ARMax, like the newer Gamesharks, loads its software from a CD. This is a major annoyance for me. Every time you load a game you must insert the ARMax memory card (which does I don't know what) and CD, go sit on the couch and wait for the software to load, choose your codes, then get up and put the actual game DVD in and wait for it to load. You can't simply turn on your PS2 and go sit down. In the old days of cartridge gaming you would snap the VGE between the game and the console so you could turn on the console and go sit down. The early generation Gamesharks had a little box that would attach to an expansion slot on the PS1 or N64 and that was it. If you wanted it to load before the game, you turned on its switch. Even if the ARMax was perfect in every other way (and it's not, btw), it would get a maximum of 4 stars as long as you had to boot it from a CD first. I mean, why can't the memory card part of it at least hold the codes for even just the current game you're playing after the system is shut off or reset so you don't have to load the software EVERY D@MN TIME.Ok, rant over. On to the codes. The user interface for the ARMax is better than the Gameshark. Functionally, they are very similar of course, but the ARMax just feels cleaner and easier to use. It offers a Beginner interface that includes descriptions of code functions (not for user-entered ones though, if I remember right), and a more robust Expert Mode. On big advantage, in theory, that the ARMax has over the Gameshark is its ability to update itself using your PS2's broadband connection. The upshot is you can download new codes for your favourite games fairly quickly instead of manually typing them all in using the controller. The dark cloud to go with this silver lining is that you have no control over which codes you download; its all or nothing. And since these updates are stored on your memory card (not the ARMax one), it will quickly fill up with codes and gamesaves for games 99% of which you will NEVER play! No wonder the ARMax has the option to come with 16 or 32MB of space on its memory card. It's to store all the useless codes! Any entered codes you choose to apply will either work, do nothing, or lock up the game. I have come across all, though to ARMax's credit, mostly the former. The absurd choice forcing you to download and save updates for every game in the PS2 library, when you may want just one, loses the ARMax another star. A note about manually entering codes: The sub-headings and folders for a game have their own codes that must be entered if you want them to show up in the game's code list.Finally, as mentioned in the reviews by Bret Morris and Glenn Nichols (Amazon.ca), the ARMax initially did not work with the new revision of the fat PS2 a couple years ago AT ALL. This happened for me as well. I returned three PS2s and two ARMaxes before I realized it was a defect in all current versions (at the time) of ARMax. I had to send away and get a new disc direct from Intec which now works as well as expected. Since the ARMax has been on shelves for several years since I bought mine, I assume any bought today would not have this problem. However, at the time there was no way to find out about this problem without contacting Intec personally. Retailers were not aware of the problem and no notices were posted on the CodeJunkies web site. This inadequate treatment of a widespread problem drops ARMax down to two stars.In my opinion, if you're in the market for a VGE, both ARMax and Gameshark have their pros and cons. I would assume both have released newer versions with newer features than the ones I have. Looks at the specs, assume nothing, and don't be afraid to e-mail the companies requesting details regarding any features you have questions about.I apologize for the length of this review, but I find there are very few in-depth reviews of VGEs on the web or in print. Maybe reviewers feel they are above using VGEs, I don't know.
- I bought this product after reading that you can update the code list via a network connection, or using a USB flash drive.  I have not been able to get either to work correctly.  After following their instructions on the Datel website on how to update the codes using a USB drive, it deleted my game saves on the memory card.  It also corrupted the memory card, and corrupted saves on the card in slot 2.  I have had nothing but trouble with it, it's slow and doesn't live up to the promises.  Their customer support is lousy, with a response that merely said...sorry.  Well thanks a lot to them...just lost hours of game saves!!
+ I honestly HATE fighting games.  I think they're boring and they don't offer anything interesting to keep me attached to them as the years go by.Enter Tekken.  Tekken has been around for many years.  When it first came out, everyone loved it.  It used to compete with Virtua Fighter on the Sega Saturn.  I was impressed then and I'm impressed now, all these years later.The action is just a lot of fun.  You really couldn't ask for a better fighting game.  The graphic updates have really added more depth to the characters and the environments.  I love the game and I hope you do, as well
+ Ahh, the Tekken series. Probably the most influential series of 3D fighting games outside of the Virtua Fighter games. Tekken 5 is a welcome return to form for this true master of the genre. With the 4th game just a distance memory, this takes the series forward (or back, depending on how you look at things). Tekken 5 uses the tried and trusted Tekken game-play, while still making everything feel fresh. Characters, that once before were just mere clones of certain main ones, are now fully fleshed out - with moves of their own. Anna Williams for example, is now not a clone of her sister Nina. When people mention Tekken, they usually think of people who have mastered every single command and move, while spending hours upon hours practising to hone their 'mad skillz' - as it were. Making the game unplayable for beginners to the genre. This, I think, is far from the truth. Tekken 5 welcomes new and veterans to the series alike. Whereas button-bashing pretenders to Tekken's crown, coughDeadorAlivecough, leave you feeling somewhat cold. Tekken on the other hand leaves you feeling a great sense of satisfaction when you play. Yes, Tekken 5 has its button-bashing characters - but every single character IS unique... and how unique they look! Arguably the best looking PS2 game to date. With gorgeous backdrops, fluid, realistic animation and textures that would look at home on any next-gen console.Music wise, it's back to form mix between techno/dance we've come to know and love from Tekken. The least we say about Tekken 4's music the better! You've got your usual Story mode to run through with each character. To see why they've entered the tournament, etc. But this 5th edition borrows the human AI mode of Virtua Fighter 4. This has replaced the Arcade mode in name, and pits you against humans who have uploaded/downloaded their data from the Tekken arcade machine from all over the world. It's a welcome challenge, even though it doesn't even compare to facing a real-life human opponent. All-in-all, this is the true homecoming of a master. Easily the best Tekken to date, and probably the best 3D fighter in existence. Though I am partial to abit of Soul Calibur... heh
- I honestly do not like cheat devices, but since Wild Arms 4 came out, it actually now has a use. Let me explain...Unfortunately, thanks to an programming on the part of Xseed Puplishing (the company that translated Wild Arms 4) it is impossible to unlock two of the bonus contents in the game without the aid of this device, or a similar device like a Gameshark. Since this is the cheapest of all said devices, if you are hellbent on unlocking everything in that game, you'll want to shell out the twenty dollars for this.If it wasn't for this reason, I wouldn't even be interested in this product.
+ With Tekken 5, the folks at Namco have crafted the best edition yet of the long running fighting franchise.  Featuring a horde of fighters, undoubtadly the best lineup yet, Tekken 5 features the same deep game-play and combo mechanics that will keep you playing for quite some time.  And because it's Tekken, there's a bevy of hidden characters and features to unlock as well.  There's no Tekken Force mode this time around, and instead there is Devil Within, a segment that is similar to Tekken Force where you play as Jin Kazama as he battles his way to learn of the devil gene within him.  It's not much to write home about in itself, but there's more features to behold here as well, including the addition of playing the arcade versions of Tekken 1, 2, and 3 as well as the Namco shooter Starblade.  The graphics are improved and the backgrounds have been revamped as well, all helping make Tekken 5 the best fighter not just for the PS2, but for home consoles in general.  For veterans to the series and newcomers alike, Tekken 5 is a masterpiece, and essential to every PS2 owner's library
+ In terms of overall quality, this game is light-years better than Tekken 4.  The graphics are terrific, the game-play has improved dramatically, and they got rid of that annoying position change feature.  I especially love the customization feature.  My only problem is playing against Jinpachi, who usually takes me about 15 tries before getting a lucky shot to beat him.  Other than that, this game is terrific
+ This is a vary good game one of the best on the PS2 these are my top ten favourite fighters 1) Asuka Kazama2) Christie Monteior3) Ling Xiaoyu4) Kazuya Mishima5) Jin Kazama6) King7) Eddy Gordo8) Nina Williams9) Anna Williams10) Devil JinThe only bad thing is Jinpachi Mishima cant be unlocked which sucks the DevilWithin mini game is ok Arcade is ranked overall the games is awesome and addicting you'll be playing for hours on end later.   
+ I have this Monster component cable and its proprietary optical cable (about $65 for both) and can say that it's the best connection you can find for your old XBOX. However, I can't really recommend them due to their high prices. If you can find the Microsoft HD pack, get that as it's much cheaper and accepts a generic optical cable. The only reason I bought this setup was because of their length (10 feet) which can go from one side of my entertainment center (where the xbox is) to the other side (where the stereo receiver is
- Then this will not work on your console.But if you have the huge old ps2 console then this will work on you console.If you do have the slim console then you should get a game shark
- I purchased this remote control to make watching DVD's on the PS2 easier.  I had problems getting it to work consistantly right out of the box.  I had to press most of the buttons very hard to get them to work.  I hoped it would get better but it only got worse.  I am now back to using the game controler and threw the remote control away.I would NEVER recommend this product. 
- As far as I am concerned this game is total garbage and I would not recomend it to any one. I do not know why it was ever released..!! Deer hunter 2003 is the same way I tossed both of them in the garbage. Trophy hunter 2003 is a much different story. The game play is very good and the graphics are up to par with todays fast computers..
+ One feature that hasn't been mentioned much is the cable shielding - you can turn the volume up all the way on your tv, and you won't hear any extra noise from EMF.Also, make sure you check your xbox settings once you've plugged this in; once you connect a high-def adapter, you will have new options under Display Settings for choosing HD capabilites. Make sure you at least give yourself the option of 480p and 720p, otherwise there isn't that much difference
- This intercooler WILL ruin your 360 with prolonged use. I was getting Error 68 codes and couldn't figure out why. Turns out it was the Intercooler sucking too much power from the 360. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
- I had this in my cart and just "Thought" it sounded like a useful tool to protect my investment. I cannot thank ALL of you who were honest and told me what damage this could do.Thank you all again! mckinle
- This product was not designed by the 360 team, and really most products that aren't aren't very good for your 360.This is no exception, it can and has been known to actually damage, and destroy your 360.  A statement from an 360 representative is to not but this product, it has caused numerous problems for a lot of people.  Mainly because it actually draws power from the 360, and that's not good, and leads to a lot of other problems.
- My Xbox was getting the red rings of death, figured this was most likely due to overheating, so I bought this thing. Not only did it not fix any of my troubles, I was having more. Whenever I would bump my Xbox, the whole thing would shut-off instantly. Found this out by accident, come to find out this thing has very bad connections. So for $20 you can buy more headaches than Microsoft is pawning off onto us game addicts...
- This is the worst item you can get for your 360. I got one and started experiencing many problems with my 360. It was crashing and freezing and ultimately I had to get my console repaired. Do not get this unless you want to hurt your baby (360)
- I'll be brief:First of all: out of the 81 reviews of this product currently on Amazon, 31 are 1-star.  That should tell you something.Pros:When it actually works, it /does/ cool down your 360.Cons:1) CrashingCaused more crashes than it prevented.  Running without the Nyko instantly reduced the number of crashes and freezing problems I had.2) Loud as hellTurn on your 360.  Put a hairdryer next to it, and turn it on, on low.  Step back and sit where you normally play.  That is how loud this product will make your 360.3) Hard to set up, frequently stops working.It took a lot of playing around just to get it to work the first time.  It snap fits well to the back of the 360, but despite that, there's some impossible magic to the angles and tightness of the power connector... we're talking millimeter tolerances here.  If you're off by just a tiny bit, it won't work at all, and the XBox won't even power on.  This wouldn't be too bad if you only had to go through this headache once, but no: it's loose enough that you risk disconnecting it (and setting it up all over again) every time you touch the power cord or move the 360.4) Many people have reported this unit causing actual damage to their 360s.  You better have a replacement plan for your 360 handy, and never mention the Nyko when you try to RMA your box.  If you let it slip, you probably won't be covered.That's it for the Nyko.  I returned mine within 2 weeks.I've been searching for a good cooler for the 360 since I got one.  Unfortunately, it is my opinion that there are NO GOOD COOLERS FOR THE 360 ON THE MARKET.  The fan-stands (yes, I've bought and returned them) are decent coolers, but require you to run your 360 vertically, which is a big no-no.  A number of websites have shown that the 360 DVD-rom drive will EAT your DVDs and games when it's vertical.  I had hoped this was overexaggerated, but then the problems started happening to me... I'ver personally seen what appears to be damage on my /mint/ condition games when running the 360 vertically.  I also experienced frequent game-loading problems (including hideous slowdowns) in games like Halo 2 (where you can actually see a progress bar) when played on a vertical 360 (it worked just fine with it horizontally).  So, horizontal is the way to go.In the end, I ended up building my own cooler out of some old (still loud, but MUCH QUIETER) computer fans and a 12 volt adapter, and slapped it on the side.  Works well, probably cools as well as the Nyko, but without the noise or the crashing!  Your best bet, if you can't do something like that, is to just buy a little clip fan (with its own power adapter) and have it blow into the right side/bottom (the vents away from the DVD drive) of your 360
- I bought this for my XBox 360 and it doesn't work at all, which is a good thing considering the other reviews I've read here. At least, by not working, it isn't damaging my Xbox 360
+ I had similar difficulties with this hi-def adapter. For one thing, the plugs were nearly impossible to get into the sockets. And once I did get them on, all I got was a black screen. But thanks to a friend, I figured out what the problem was:If you're having trouble getting those Monster cables attached (and who hasn't?), you should get a DeoxIT ProGold Kit by Caig. It's just two very small cans of stuff that help clean off your connectors and, more importantly, act as a temporary lubricant. I got my kit at Radio Shack. I think it was about twelve bucks.As for not getting any picture at all, that was my fault. I didn't realize that two of the sets of inputs on my TV are for 1080i only. Once I moved the plugs to the proper jacks, and turned off the signals that did not apply in my Xbox dashboard, the picture was sharp and bright.The cables are good quality. My only problem with them is that proprietary digital audio connector. It's kind of lame of Monster to require you to buy their special optical cable that comes with the right adapter. Other than that, if you've got the cash, get these cables, and that Caig kit
+ Monster cables have superior construction and always deliver the best quality sound and video.  They cost a little more but I found mine on amazon cheap and got free shipping.  Saved $20 over retail and got shipment within 3 days.  I'm happy
- I bought this from Best Buy yfor $25 dollars thinking it would give my Xbox360 a longer life and keep it's insides cool.When I plugged it in, my Xbox360 didn't turn on AT ALL.  After trying it several times, I took it off and plugged in the AC adapter back on to my Xbox.  For a while, the Xbx wouldn't turn on.  I thought it was broken.  I gave a it a few minutes and luckily it turned back on, but that Intercooler nearly broke my Xbox.DON"T BUY IT
- First of all, it's sad that someone would put out a product (the 360) that gets so hot that it tends to fry itself, unless you spend another 10% of the product cost on a little series of fans.Second, I attached this. I plugged it in. It wouldn't even turn on. Waste of money. Do yourself a favor and just keep your machine in an open, uncluttered, unblocked area. If you absolutely must provide additional airflow, just point a $10 clip-on fan at it
+ This game is tons of fun!  My husband, children (ages 6 and 7) and I have had hours and hours of enjoyment from this game.  I definetely recommend that your children be able to read fluently to thoroughly enjoy the game.  This game is also great for informal parties, as an ice breaker. 
- I played this game until Chapter 23. All the Dancing Levels were VERY HARD to beat! I think this game is not worth buying-- rent it
+ It's a pretty fun game.  It doesn't have a whole lot of songs, maybe around 30-40, but the ones that it does have are fun to sing and are songs that generally a lot of people know, or would be willing to learn.  There are also several different modes to play in, so you can play the game over and over and never get tired of it.  Perhaps one of the best features is that up to 8 people can play without any extra expansion packs or controllers; all you need is one controller and the USB headset and you just pass it around for everyone to play.I agree with everyone else, though, when they say the headset is very flimsy.  I originally was going to get a separate headset but bought the package deal.  Bad idea.  You practically have to eat the thing to sing, and it IS small and will get caught in long hair.  Plus, you don't get the fun karaoke experience.  My advice: buy the game separately, then get the handheld mic.  As soon as I get some more money I'm gonna get the handheld mic myself, it picks your voice up better.Overall, a good buy!  And lots of fun, especially if you have a lot of outgoing, un-self-conscious people
+ this game is HARD, but very fun so if you want to pick between Fantastic Four or some other comic book game, just get the hulk... and if you do, collect your patience because this game will hand it to you
- My son begged for this game, and the price is reasonable compared to some games so we added it to our collection.  He enjoyed levels 1and2, but once we got to level 3 that was it!  Unless you have earned the nickname "Fast fingers" or "Fury Feet" don't bother purchasing this until you rent it.  I spent an hour trying to beat level 3 for my 6 year old the only thing I discovered was that I did equally as well when I randomly hit the 4 keys as quickly as possible (about 57% accurate) as I did actually keeping up.  Being this is only level 3 I can only imagine the "Dance Levels" get harder from here, Good Luck!!
+ The game when you first buy it is awesome. I mean who wouldent want to throw cars at helicopters, make people fly 20 yards with your finger, and bunt-kick a police car down 5 blocks? the game lasts a bit because of the "smash smash get some cash" game-play (the more smash points you get, the more moves you get). the moves are the best part. at one point in the game, you get a move that lets you grab onto a helicopter or a big boss. I always loved riding the helicopter to 5th street... its alot better then skateboarding on a  bus if you ask me. anyway, once you get all the moves and beat the story mode AND get the canadian boxers, it gets extremely repetitive.at the end of the game, when you get critical alert status, the same guys always come.5/5 stars for the first 3 weeks-2 months... 4 the next month, and basically declining to 3BUT, whenever you are board and have nothin to do, no good tv is on, all of your friends are offline and every other game is getting booring, its nice to take a good ol trip back to this game and smash a mech or to.. you know, for old times sake
- This game is a joke!  It is immpossible for a child to get past level 3.  It took my husband about 20 tries to get past it, and he is a pro at video games.  (he beat mech 2 for x-box and halo2 the third time he played them.)  Don't buy this game for your kids until you rent it and let them try it out.  It is was a waste of money my kids won't even play it.  It should be rated N for Nobody
+ I would recommend this to those who just wants more than just shooting at fat ass people or aliens just slobbering on cra
- The game-play is just foolish and found the game annoying and un-fun!  The kids didn't even like it. Run, don't walk away from this dentist-office of a game JAWS-cr@p. (JAWS = Just another W. Smith
+ Great tutorial and hands-on learning.  This game is action-packed with fight moves, jumps, combos, etc.  My only complaint was Hulk's reaction time during running.  But that's easily overlooked when you blowing up stuff.  A definate buy
+ I love a good, intricate storyline in a game as much as the next person. The RPG, known for it's generally intricate plotline, is one of my favourite genres. And to The Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction's credit, it does contain a story penned by a seasoned comicbook author. And again to the game's credit, the story really isn't too bad (fairly generic, but servicable). The script is voiced adequatly, and presented in a way that doesn't deter from the real focus of the game: Rampant, wanton, gratuitous destruction in some of the most creative ways possible. I love The Hulk as a character. I even liked the Ang Lee flick (no hate mail please-myfriends give me enough crap for that one as it is). There's something cathartic about a nearly indestructable creature that operates on pure Id. Who doesn't want to just lose it when we get pushed too far? This game has many things going for it: it controls very well, nearly every object in the vast and varied environments is destructable in some way shape or form, and the graphics are certainly servicable (although not top-notch). The best way to describe this is to take an open gamespace like the Grand Theft Auto games, minus the infuriatingly difficult missions, and add a set of missions that beg you to destroy everything. Every mission is based in some way on the premise of you as a giant green demolition expert. Now this may sound like it would wear thin quickly, but the game does remain fresh do in large part to a huge selection of upgraded moves that you can 'buy' with smashpoints, which are awarded via smashing things (deep huh?). It is really a massive orgy of soothing mayhem, and mercy is it ever satisfying! If you tried out the first Hulk game, please be aware that this is NOTHING like that. There are no more tedious sneaking missions as Bruce Banner. YOU ARE THE HULK, and the Jade Giant is an absolute gas in this title. Like the GTA games, you are not forced into playing missions (although this does unlock new moves and arenas to play in). You can take on side quests which are not only pretty creative, but downright hilarious in others (try 'batter up!' for an example of the latter). If the first Hulk game and Ang Lee's movie left a sour taste in your mouth when it comes to Mr. Green Genes, then give this one a shot. In my opinion, they got the essence of the Hulk down pat, and show him for the fun character that he can be. Later!    
- my kid played the game for 5 min only, it is not fun. if you want to try it just rent I
- It's got some occasionally interesting puzzles, but the lame story and irritating characters kill whatever appeal Keepsake might have had.The Good: Unique and challenging puzzles; handy hint system helps keep the game moving.The Bad: Some of the worst voice acting you will ever hear; blurry, low-res backgrounds; dull characters and an uninteresting story
- We bought this game knowing Shrek movies are a bit raunchy, but thinking the game would be ok for a 6 year old to play.After watching my son play this game for a few minutes... I saw that he had to stun chickens and put them in a pot of boiling water while they were still alive. Then after that, he punched large turtles and threw them on tables where there backs were cracked open and died.  I can't believe a game that is rated E for Everyone would have little kids (or whoever played it) have to be so mean to animals.  What's next, ripping the head off a rabbit? I consider myself one of the coolest moms around, but this totally crossed the line
- I agree with other reviewers that the graphics and vocals are good, but I find the game-play itself less than stellar. For starters, I've always been irritated with games that don't let you save your status whenever you want. Sometimes I just want to get in a quick dose of game-play, but that's not possible with these games that require you to play through an entire section before being allowed to save.  That contributes to the repetitive, tedious nature of some sections. If you get stuck getting through a certain bit of the game, you're doomed to replay much of what led up to it over and over again.I realize that tricky camera angles are some of the challenges that are supposed to exist in this game. More than in the earlier versions, however, I have trouble getting myself lined up for whatever task. Another tedious element.I found this game to be more a test of my endurance and patience than actual fun
+ Note:  This review is spoiler free with regards to the game's storyAll good things must eventually come to an end, such as the star wars series, the lord of the rings trilogy, and the Jak and Daxter trilogy (not including the racing game and Daxter's own PSP game).  After two excellent games, our favourite elfin friend and his furry sidekick come to the last entry in the Jak trilogy.  The big question is:  Is it a good ending?  I'm pleased to say that overall, yes.Jak 3 takes place an undetermined time after the conclusion of Jak 2.  Haven city has become divided after relentless attacks by robots, metal heads and other nasties.  The population blames Jak for these problems and he finds himself flown out to the wasteland, a harsh and unforgiving desert where nobody can survive without help.  Abandoned by those he saved, Jak and his buddy Daxter set out on thier final adventure.Like it's two predecessors, Jak 3 is a platforming game combined with a gun shooter.  You get various jumps, kicks, punches and leaps, and you also get a wide array of firearms to take out your foes when your fancy Kung-Fu and karate aren't enough.  Jak's moves remain largely unchanged from Jak 2 (which will now be called J2).  He can still punch like a man, jump like a kangaroo, and leap like a bullfrog.  Gunplay remains pretty much the same as well.  You get four guns (blaster, rifle, machine gun and peacemaker), but in a nice twist, each weapon gets various upgrades as the game goes on.  The rifle for example, starts out in it's default setting.  Hower, the next upgrade allows it to shoot richochet bullets while the third upgrade gives it a flying platform that shoots bullets in all directions.  Each gun has three upgrades and playing with them is a blast.  The peace maker for example, can fire a shot that paralyzes all enemies and makes them float around (whee!) while it's final upgrade...well, let's just say that you'll be shooting mini-nukes a lot.The biggest change to Jak's game play comes in the form of  vehicles.  While J2 had flying vehicles and zoomers, Jak 3 has cars (and not the nice, talking Pixar kind).  Because half the game is set in the desert, Jak and Daxter get around on dune buggies.  There are eight of them and each has various unique traits.  Some are really, really fast, one can jump riddiculously high (wheee!) and some of them will spin out of control at the slightest twitch of the control stick (boo!).  You'll be spending a lot of time driving the buggies and for the most part, it's enjoyable and fun, though some of them (such as the sand shark) can be a bit difficult to handle.Another new feature of Jak 3 is the sheer size of it.  J1 and J2 had two enormous areas to run around in.  Here, you have not one, not two, but three, yes, three! gigantic areas to run around in.  And like the previous games, there are no loading times, an astonishing feat considering how enormous both worlds (Spargus city, the wasteland and Haven city) are.  You'll definatly see a lot of amazing sights during your trips throughout Jak 3's world (such as how Haven city has...ahem...changed since the last game).Dark Jak powers return as well, but are now balanced by a new side to our hero...light Jak.  If Dark Jak is the attacking force, Light Jak is the defensive force.  Dark allows you to kill things really quickly, while Light allows you to heal, fly (this is so AWESOME!), surround yourself with an inpenetrable shield, and even slow down time to a crawl.  Both powers can be activated at any time as long as you have light and dark eco in your meters.  And in a very nice touch, you can stop being light or dark at a touch of a button to save your energy for when you really need it.  While both light and dark do come into play at vital moments during game-play, both are really just a little added bonus to spice up game-play when you want to, as you can play throughout the game without needing to use either force (except for scripted moments where you need to).  But then again, being able to heal yourself whenever you want is a very handy thing! *smile*Like J2, Jak 3 has you going from place to place, talking to people and doing what they tell you to do.  And when you finish with that, you head over to the next person and do what they want to do, etc.  It's a linear system that makes it easy to tell where to go and what to do next and it sounds fairly restrictive, but it does have one big strength:  You don't have to start the next mission until you want to.  If you want, you can wander around the wasteland blowing up wanderers for twenty hours, go hunt down twelve precurser orbs and watch the sun go up and down three times, and then tackle the mission.  This free roaming system allows you to do what you'd like to do if you don't feel like doing missions for a while.One thing I'd like to address before we go any further is the difficulty level.  If one takes a look at my review for J2, one can find a lot of anger and hatred directed towards Naughty dog for making J2 the most unnecessarily hardest game I've ever played (and it still is by the way, tied only with Spider man for PS2).  I am very pleased that Naughty Dog towned down the difficulty a lot for Jak 3.  No longer does each and every mission require twenty attempts before you pass it, and no longer will you be throwing the controller into the TV while screaming obscenities becuase that a**hole Errol won that fricken race again.  Here, the difficulty seems just right.  Not too hard, not too easy.  Most missions require a few attempts before they are completed, and a few can be finished on one try.  There are still a few that are quite difficult, and one or two that are grit-your-teeth inducing, but overall, nothing as infuriating as many moments from the previous entry in the series.  Oh, and there are only a few "go through the ring" missions this time around.  Thank goodness.In addition to the free-roaming game-play, there are also plenty of secrets to unlock in this quest.  There are over 600 precurser orbs to find and collect in Jak 3, and by doing so you get to unlock various features such as unlimited dark and light Jak power, invincibility, extra vehicles, various weapon upgrades, etc.  While some are hidden behind corners, many of these orbs are collected by doing various challenges that people throw your way, such as searching around a paticular area, going through rings (grumbles), following a little blue light and even stopping time.  There are plenty of things to do to get those little shiny orbs, but the results are well worth it.In addition, Jak 3 arguably has the best moments in the series in terms of "wow" factor.  Fighting a gigantic sixty story tall monster with only a dune buggy is a moment that sends shivers down your spine.Even with all these fine points, Jak 3 does stutter a little bit in what is arguably the most important part of the game...the story.  J2 is most memorable to me for it's story.  It had many twists and turns and you never really knew what to expect next.  The story in Jak 3 is a good one and it does keep your interest in what is going to happen next...but ultimitly, it left me unsatisfied.  How so?  The three biggest ones are charachters, the precursers and the ending.And for those of you worrying that I'm going to tell you who the precursers are (which I won't) I'm going to keep this as spoiler free as I can.First off, the charachters.  We have Jak and Daxter of course, and those two are always fun to watch and care about.  We have many returning charachters such as Torn, Sig, and Samos, and we have some new residents from Spargus city.  The problem?  Almost all of the returning charachters have zilch charachter development.  It's assumed that you know them from the last game and because of that, Jak 3 takes no time to explain who they are or what they do.  That may be okay, but pretty much none of the charachters are expanded at all.  Torn is still gruff and tough (but not as much as last time), Ashelin is the firm leader, and Samos gives warnings on what may happen to the planet if things go badly.  Keira, who was such a vital charachter in J1 and J2, has absoloutly nothing to do in the story aside from look pretty and important.  Sig...well, he's just there because he's cool.  The only returning charachter who kept me interested was Tess, who fufills the "dumb blonde" role.  Her relationship with Daxter is sweet and lighthearted and kept my interest easily.  Errol returns as well (though I won't say how), but he's gone from "insanely irritating" to "average irritating", a sad departure from his compellingly egotistic nature in J2.  Of the new charachters, only one, Damos, kept my interest due to his charachter.  Tough, yet gentle and caring at the same time, he's easily the most compelling of Jak's new companions.  The new villian, count Veger, isn't that compelling, though he does have some very powerful scenes (especially one near the ending).One of the claims on the back of the game box is that we'll discover the shocking secret of who the precursers really are.  As I said earlier, I won't reveal who the precursers are (someone did that and ruined the suprise for me), except that in my personal opinion, we should have never find out who the precursers were and leave them as a mystery.  I personally felt that seeing who they really are sucked out all the suspense and mystery, esepcially since they have been talked about at length for two games now.  It's like revealing the face of doctor claw.  When you go back and experience your old memories, there is no more mystery or wonder anymore.  In my personal opinion, these beings should have remained hidden forever.However, the saddest part of the game for me is the ending.  Again, I won't ruin it for you, but it's always sad when game developers have to wrap an entire trilogy up in three minutes.  Some people criticise the ending of the film, Return of the King, saying that it goes on too long.  However, the ending to the lord of the rings film trilogy took it's time wrapping up the threads from three movies and bringing closure to the story and leaving one satisfied.  However, Jak 3 doesn't do that.  As the game goes on and gets closer to the end, the feeling of dread and the idea that everything can be destroyed just vanishes and is pretty much gone by the time the final boss battle comes (and sadly, the battle itself isn't that exciting or memorable).The ending does end the trilogy, but leaves the door wide open for more games (of which two have already happened).  I've invested a lot of time on these three games, I've grown attatched to it's charachters and I would like closure to all thier stories.  Saldy, that doesn't happen.  Everything is left wide open when, in my opinion, it should have been closed.  There is no real ending here, at least, one that ties everything up nicely.But despite my points with the story, I do want to stress that Jak 3 is a very good game.  It's a satisfying blend of storytelling, platforming, shooting, driving, and action.  It's one of those games where you keep saying "Just five more minutes, just five more minutes", only to discover that time has flown by and it's two in the morning.  It's addictive, fun, and, for me, a blast to play.  I definitly recommend it, especially if you find it for under twenty dollars
- I bought the KR Party bundle for my boyfriend's daughter for her birthday. She loves the game, but it has only been about two weeks and the mic is dead. It started with the static for a while, but then while I was singing, it just died completely. I know I'm not a great singer, but I'm not THAT bad
+ 5 stars is a very low number compared to how good this game is.  Light jak is freakin awesome, after awhile u really get attached to this game and of course the charchters themselves.                        A MUST BUY FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR A NON-STOP ACTION GAME
+ INTRO.Jak 3 is the ending to the Jak and Daxter trilogy, and I have to say that it pulled it off quite nicely. There are a few flaws in the game, but nothing major. You start out as Jak, now an exile from Haven City because of people who distrust him and his dark powers. He is taken in by the people of the Wasteland and the story continues from there.GAMEPLAYOnce again, Jak moves very fluidly and nicely and has the exact same controls as the last game (except for certain new powers like Light Jak). And, once again, the animators have done a wonderful job of making lush, detailed landscape and characters. Sunsets and sunrises are done well, and nothing looks cut and pasted on to the walls, like Spyro-era games. I like the way that in this game you get to move between Haven City and the Wasteland. This way you get even more terrain to explore than in the last game. Additionally, you get control of Light Jak powers! I thought this was a nice twist and a nice way to add in something new for the people who enjoyed the Dark Jak option. One thing that personally irks me...they took away Keira's voice actor! She barely speaks and when she does, it's not the same person. At least the other Keira had a role! also, the ending felt a little dragged out and towards the end of the game, I was just hoping that it would finish soon instead of prolonging it with more crammed-in missions.PROS and CONSPros:1. Nice characters2. No glitches so far3. No loading times4. Detailed landscape5. New powers and old: Dark Jak and Light Jak6. Good switches between areasCons:1. Blasting people or monsters over and over can get annoying.2. The ending seemed to go at the pace of a SNAIL.OVERALLA nice finish to the series! If you bought the first two, you'll most definitely be drawn to this one anyway. :
- I bought this mic in December and after only two nights of singing, it completely died!  What a complete disappointment.  Save your money! 
+ This was a present for my brother so I don't know what it was like, but he said "it is the best 3rd person game on the x-box
+ This game has outstanding graphics and great 3-D game-play, plus you can really battle it out online or in instant action. To add to the few, you can play in the Clone Wars or the Galactic Civil War, the bad thing though is that in the Clone Wars the main battles are on Naboo, to be honest the Clone Wars started on Geonosis and are in Episode II not I. I love this game because you can use guns and other awesome weapons, and you can also play as the wookies, clones, droids, rebels, and Imperials. If you are a beginner video game player or new to Star Wars when you choose "CREATE FILE" try using easy. This game follows the movies really well and you can explore Mos Eisley or maybe Naboo if you like. The more battles you win, the bonuses you get. If you read the Instruction Booklet it says if you go on a Killing Spree against the enemies you get a really cool bonus. I Highly Recommend this game to all Star Wars fans! The game will let you play the most greatest battles of all time. So, if you want a good long-lasting game try this, I really hope Star Wars fans will love the game. Multi-Player mode is great and I really enjoy playing it. This game is great and I love it. Try playing it for yourself! I am about to wrap this review up so listen, THAT THIS GAME IS GREAT FOR THE XBOX AND HAS TERRIFIC GAMEPLAY AND FEATURES THAT YOU WILL WANT TO PLAY IT ALL THE TIME EVEN THOUGH IT IS ONLINE OR SINGLE-PLAYER YOU CAN STILL HAVE FUN AND KNOW IT IS ALL OUT STAR WARS ACTION! THIS GAME IS GREAT AND I JUST LOVE PLAYING IT! I know that this is one out of two battle front games soon to be three I enjoy playing this! BUY IT....NOW! P.S. BUY EVERY THING STAR WARS
+ I'll admit that being able to go around as a stormtrooper and kill everything in sight is fun.  Wicked fun.  This game delivers if you want to have a good time playing a FPS involving Star Wars.  The major drawback to the game is the targetting.  It's like using a sniper rifle in Halo 1 but the reticle is the size the one for the assault rifle.  You can turn on the auto-aim option to help with accuracy but then the reticle tends to follow an enemy on screen and it's more difficult to shoot over an ally's shoulder.  Another drawback is that you can't jump/fall and shoot at the same time like in other FPSs.  Plus, fighters are hard to learn how to use as are other vehicles.  You can still do fine as a footsoldier but it would be nice if the vehicles were a little easier to use
- This game is, simply put, not good. I got bored to tears playing it, then ended up giving it away because it was robbing useful space on my desk. It is slow-paced, predictable, and not suspenseful at all. In fact, these characteristics are probably why it's so mainstream, even though it's laughable in comparison to real first-person shooters, which by the way don't even belong on consoles. Owning at this game means you are an average player. Any true FPS gamer knows what childish, pathetic garbage this is, while the rest just go with the hype. Many have successfully deceived themselves into thinking it's worth anything at all. It isn't
+ This is the first wireless controller that I have ever used that didn't LAG constantly.  In fact mine has never lagged not even when the batteries were low.  The range is more than enough for any room in my home.  Actually I have taken it outside between online mathces and kept chatting with the other players so it even works through doors and windows.  Great product that I now have two of them and have retired the wired controller
+ this is one of the best controller I ever have.grip, felling ,and handeled are good as experience. I recomende
+ Bought this as a gift for my granson.  It is awesome.  Many games to pick from and the ease of use is great.  He's only five and works the buttons with ease.  Plus you can take it anywhere.  Great price here too. Cheaper than anyone else
+ Seriously though, this game is awesome. I bought this game simply because I had heard it was good, and I am glad I did. The plot is great, actually worthy to bear the star wars name. The story is what makes this game great and the ending is satisfying. It has everything, tons of action and fighting, emotional dialogue, lots of choices and even a few occasional hints of romance. The basic story is this (and don't worry I wont tell you too much). You are a soldier for the republic that gets involved in the rescue of a Jedi, who you develop a kind of mysterious bond with. Through out the game you travel to several planets, including Tatooine, Kashyyyk, Dantooine and several new ones, never mentioned in the original movies.  
- I used to love this game, but there are so many better games out there, plus this game is overrated, with a not so good storyline, and nerdy weapons, it's just not good
+ I recived KOTOR for christmas. I was skeptical - the front picture was strange to me. I popped it in, installed and started playing. Three weeks later, I was completely into it. It is one of the funnest games that I have ever played. The missions and the completely customizable characters make this the best star wars RPG, ranking up there with World of Warcraft and other hyper-popular RPGs
- I purchased this game when it was new, and my computer while meeting the requirements just couldn't run it. I put he game in a box and just a month ago found it again. The computer I have now should be able to run the game thrice simultaneously with all options on highest settings. Yet the game will randomly crash and cause my computer to restart and losing my 4mins to 2 hours work. I contacted tech support and got what I am now sure are just something for me to try until I quit trying and leave them alone. It worked. They win. They got my money and I got jack
- The copy of SimCity4 that I purchased came without the access codes to support instillation. When I called Electronic arts all I got was an automated phone system... press 2 now... EA's manufacturing quality control is so poor that they had a selection for products without access codes! I could never find a way to talk with a human beibng about the problem. The automated voice suggested solution was to send the product to them at my expsnse to prove that it came without the access code! I have returned the game to Amazon for a refund. I would never buy another EA product
+ It's a very good product but it only can be shipped within U.S., so I can't buy I
+ you can connect this to the game boy player as well plus connect it to the e-reader to download e-reader information into your cub
- I bought one of these for my daughter as a gift and found that I need one for each GBA or SP.  So I bought another one for my son.  Then after we couldn't get them to work and consulted Nintendo we found that the wireless adapter doesn't work for all multi-player games and there are only a few games that will work with the wireless version.  Some gift
+ Mario and Luigi Partners in Time to me takes me back to the SNES, with the first Mario RPG "Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars" a game I absolutely love (and would also recommend to anyone with an SNES or an emulator). The reason is the general game-play for this RPG hasn't changed. You move around different screens, attack the enemies, fight bosses, etc. There is definitely a unique (and I suppose you might consider it simplistic) ideology that this game follows. It's an easier version of action/RPGs, you level up, battles aren't random (you can see the enemies you engage on screen) though it is turn-based. This game plays and feels much like the original legend of the seven stars, but has added its own twists and funny little story line to make it, it's own game.I highly recommend this game to anyone who doesn't mind a lot of chatting, but even more action and puzzles! Another homerun for Mario RPGs
- I have always been a fan of fighting games.  As far as 3D ones go, I have great experience in the Dead or Alive series and proficiency with Soul Calibur 2.  I fear that Dead or Alive and Soul Calibur may have spoiled me though.  Recently I bought Mortal Kombat Deception and found it horribly awkward* compared to the fluid battles of Soul Calibur or Dead or Alive.  I felt the same way when I played Tekken 5.  Unlike the graceful and awesome animations of Dead or Alive or Soul Calibur, the movements of the characters in Tekken 5 are unrealistic and absurd.  Try out Christie in Tekken 5 for example.  Her idle animation is preposterous.  If you have access to Dead or Alive 3, try putting out Leifang.  Her idle animation is a thing of beauty.  Every one of her moves flows perfectly from one to the next.  This kind of grace is seriously lacking in the clunky Tekken 5.And now let us speak of character design.  Tekken 5's characters are boring and uninspired.  They run the gamut from miscellaneous boxer 1, 2, 3, and 4, to miscellaneous karate fighter 1, 2, 3, and 4.  Oh.  There are also a few shrieky girls in tight clothing, some of which seem to be Asian, if that's your thing.  And then there's a guy in a cat mask.  As awesome as that sounds, it looks silly in the game.If you have ever played Practice Mode on Dead or Alive you will probably recall with fondness that there is a feature that shows each move command at the top of the screen and keeps it there until you successfully perform that move.  This feature, as useful as it is, is not present in Tekken 5.  To be fair, it isn't found in any other fighting game that I have played, but it really should be.Without further ado, let me simply say that I do not recommend buying Tekken 5 if you have ever played Soul Calibur or Dead or Alive.  The intro video is about as much excitement as the game can offer (I especially enjoyed the suicidal bicycle girl that rescued the kitten).*But at least Mortal Kombat Deception had Puzzle Kombat, which rocked my socks
+ I love this game.  Once I started playing I couldn't stop.  My DS battery is dead after like 3 days I play so much.  Once you get into the game it is really hard to stop playing.  You get new moves and new weapons thus making the game new all the time.  The controls are easy to learn and the story is easy to get into.  So lets all tip our hats to nintendo and all there Mario greatness
- Sure it looks good and the game-play is ok but the final boss (Jinpachi) is really cheap and lame! Even at the "easy" difficulty, just a couple of hits from this freak and you're dead! The Devil Within mini-game is also stupid, some levels are just impossible and too hard. I wouldn't mind it if you could save your game whenever you want to or at least just before some critical part of the game but unfortunately that is not the case here, not to mention some save points are hidden. Imagine getting through the most boring levels doing extremely tedious yet dumb puzzles, spending around 2 hours or more to get to the boss level, then finally finding yourself trying over and over to beat the boss until you just give up but you can't save your game, then you're gonna have to redo the entire level again!!! That is one sick stupid game design! The only reason I'm playing this mini-game is just to get the hidden items
- If you're looking to spend money on this, don't. Having spent my teen years holed up in my bedroom on a Commodore 64 (and being the current fan that I am), I was really excited when I heard about this product. Unfortunately, it stinks. There are a couple of games on this contraption that are real gems, the rest being mediocre at best. The overall bad choice of games isn't my issue with this thing though. It's the CRUMMY JOYSTICK. Control is horrible. The stick is clunky and unresponsive and makes playing a real chore. As someone else pointed out in their review, often it doesn't even respond when pushed in a certain direction. I can't believe it's 2006 yet these companies releasing plug-n-play video game contraptions can't even make a decent joystick! A real let-down
+ Spyro was one of the first games my 5 year old ever played.  It was challenging enough for him without being too frustrating.  There are alot of Xbox games on the market that are for more mature audiences but this one was perfect for a 5 year old. This game was not meant for an adult gaming audience.  I was surprised when I realized this game is no longer in production.  There should be more games for the 5-10 age bracket.  My son loves this game.  He literally wore it out.  I have to find him another copy of Hero's Tail to replace his old one
- Not as much fun as I remember. Maybe better if they had a better selection of games (One on One, Hardball, etc.
- I purchased this product for my niece,having had positive experiences with similar items,and finding the price to be too tempting.However,what had been the hope of introducing her to the video games of my generation turned into an exercise in frustration from the outset.The screw to the battery casing stripped with very little application of a screwdriver,the titles suffered from redundancy,and many of them required the use of too many buttons.What was the most disappointing aspect of this item was the potential it possessed; perhaps fewer similar titles and a re-configuration of the button commands would ensure the promise of this product
- I was really excited when I saw this item was out!  I had the Commodore 64 when I was a kid, and my brother and I used to spend hours and hours playing games on it.  I was so glad to see that Winter Games and Summer Games was included.... until the item arrived and I plugged it in and tried to play with it.. the joystick doesn't work at ALL when you move it to the right.  So, you can only use it to go up down or left. BIG Dissapointment.  Don't waste your $$
+ You get to be different animals. It is a really cool game. I recommend it to other kids to buy. The cheetah get shoot bow and arrows
+ I got this for X-mas and I am a huge Spyro fan! I started with the second one and this is now the fifth release not counting gameboy games, and the second on Playstation 2. The last one, Enter the Dragonfly wasn't SO successful and I feared there wouldn't be another; but here it is! And SO many things have been added. Buying items at item shops, keychains for keys to open boxes, riding around in the professors new gadget ball, mini-games featuring not Spyro, but his friends,etc. I kind of miss flying Spyro through the rings in the speed race, but...This new Spyro is clearly trying to keep up with newer platform games that others seem to enjoy, but luckily they have kept things from being too hard that you give up eventually and you don't have to worry about wandering around and getting lost in the game. Spyro must learn new tricks like spin pole,etc. as he moves along, and he even meets little dragons like him- Ember,Flame. Hard enough to keep you playing to get through the challenge, but it never seems overwhelming. Some of the mini-game's second levels are a pain, but you can come back later. The strategy guide is also helpful. This time, I don't think anyone can complain that Spyro hasn't evolved or that it's the same old thing, but Spyro fans love Spyro even if it was the same game but with new adventures and levels. He's Spyro! Hours of enjoyment
+ I wanted this workout "game" to get back into shape after having a baby. It is a great workout including cardio, combat, isolation for abs, arms or legs, and mind and body including yoga and tai chi-type exercises. I love that it tells you what day to work out (and if you don't you fail that day!) and it increases the intensity of the workouts based on your previous performance. There are several different workouts in each segment so each workout is truely unique to help prevent burnout. Your workouts are assigned a letter grade based on your performance so it motivates me to get the allusive "A", which is hard to achieve (and it should be!). I am in week 8 of the 12 week program and I can definintely feel my muscles are more toned and firm after not working out for a year. I love that Nike helped produce the game.I recommend this game to anyone; however, I have issues with the eyetoy camera. You would think I would get how the camera works after 8 weeks but I still have problems. Sometimes it indicates that I touched something I was nowhere near, and sometimes it takes me 2 or 3 tries for it to register that I touched something. You're still getting the workout, but I'm working towards getting a good letter grade. I want credit for what I'm doing right. The combat exercises are frustrating as I have a hard time believing I'm not punching hard enough and often receive a 0 score. I've started working out at night as the sunlight from the windows makes the camera less responsive. There have been a couple of times that I've walked to the left of the screen and my body triggered the "try again" button after a cardio workout...so I had to do the 10 minute workout again as history has shown when I try to exit out of it, the game fails me for the day for quitting.All in all I'm happy with the workouts, but just know that the camera takes some getting used to. I hope others have better luck with it than I have. My husband does the 12 week program also and he's lost 10 pounds and I've lost 9
- DOn't buy this - it will crash your entire xbox.  Learn to play - forget the cheats
+ Wow - that's all I can say. All the positive reviews really piqued my interest on this 'game'. Just got it a few days ago, and am SO IMPRESSED with all that's packed into it!!! It also teaches proper form for a ton of different toning and stretching excercises. This is going to become a regular part of my workout regimen. People of all fitness levels can enjoy this. This technology (interactive virtual trainers/serious home workouts) has got to be the wave of the future!!
+ Got this for Christmas and absolutely love it! It works for everyone  on any work out level, even for beginners. There are two types of work out:  1. Routine Builder - basically you are on your own you get to pick exercises you are interested in. 2. Personal Trainer - basically you follow a 12 week program. It tracks your progress, it tells you when it is your rest day to avoid over exhaustion, it has a guide/advice on proper posture, breathing and technique. It has a good amount of stretching exercises in the beginning and end of each sessions. It even enhances balance of mind and body...very much like yoga. It also combines fluid movements like Tai Chi, rhythmic dance moves and kick boxing moves. Needless to say, I love this game! If you're looking for a good sweat without the high fees of the gym, this is the game for you.
- If you are looking for codes like Game Shark had, this is not for you.  Not only do you HAVE to have a computer, If anything happens to the disk, you are screwed.  You won't be able reinstall windows, or install it on a new computer.  Some games do offer rewards like unlimited health for %100 completion.  So if those are they games you plan on using,  this is the best thing out there
- returned item for refund; found it cheaper at Toys R U
+ I bought this game not as a video game but so I could have my own personal trainer without paying for a gym membership.  I am two weeks into my 12 week routine and I LOVE it.  The software is very well done and it really does have "real time feedback."  If I'm leaning forward when I'm not suppose to while doing an exercise the trainer will say "try standing up straight."  I am definitely getting a great work out.  10 more weeks and I'll let you know if it did any good or not.  So far it seems to be helping.  I love that it builds on itself so that by week 12 you are doing more routines that are more intense.  The one drawback is the camera is really sensitive - I have to make my kids leave the room because if they walk around in the background it picks up their movements and lowers my score.  If you hate the gym but have always wanted your own personal trainer "Kinetic" seems to be the way to go
